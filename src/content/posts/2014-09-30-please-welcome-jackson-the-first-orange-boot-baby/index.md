If you are a Saturday regular at Orange Boot, you have likely noticed two things:   our awesome front counter person Amy’s tummy has been growing quite a bit over the past several months; and Amy hasn’t been at work for a the past month or so.  Well we are pleased to inform you that little Jackson Bonsor was born last week.   7lbs, 13oz.  Healthy as can be.

We get a great thrill from all the new Moms who come into the bakery with their cute babies.  It’s so cool to watch the seasons change outside and watch the babies grow a little more every time we see them.  But this is the first time we’ve ever had an Orange Boot employee have a baby, so in our own weird way we all feel like surrogate Aunts and Uncles.

It’s a little too soon to tell whether Jackson like bread but we assume he’ll love it once he gets a little bigger.  Let’s just say that Jackson won’t go without good baking as he get older.
