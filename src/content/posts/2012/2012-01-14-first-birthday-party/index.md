**Happy New Year!**

I hope everyone had a great, relaxing season. At Orange Boot we had a welcome rest after an extremely busy December. It was so great to see so many people buying bread and cookies to complement your holiday meal or to give as a gift. It's as if we were invited to 1000 Christmas dinners this year!

**Happy Birthday to...Us!**

Wednesday, January 18 is Orange Boot Bakery's first birthday. I know! It's hard to believe we've been baking for you for an entire year now. Cindy and I have never worked harder, worked longer, or had as much stress, worry, aches and pains as we've had over the past year. We've also never experimented as much, learned as much, met as many great people, and had as much fun. The bakery has changed a lot in a year and we're very excited about our plans for Year 2.

To celebrate our birthday we're having a special 1st Birthday Party on Wednesday, January 18. There will be special treats for everyone who comes out to visit and we'll announce a brand new addition to our bread lineup too.

We will also be launching a very special contest on January 18th as well. We'll announce it first at the store and later online. We're very excited about it and I'm sure you will be too. I don't want to give away too much but you might want to spend the next few days thinking about who your best friends are. :)

That's it for now. Happy New Year and I hope to see you on the 18th for our birthday party (if not sooner!)

Best wishes,

Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn Dyck
