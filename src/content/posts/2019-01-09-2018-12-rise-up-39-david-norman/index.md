Back in 2013 I took a Bread Baker’s Guild class in Austin Texas and Easy Tiger hosted a “Guildhall Gathering.”

I instantly fell in love with this bake shop and beer garden right in the heart of downtown. From the massive bread wall to the bakers working in the background to the beer and pretzels, it seemed like the perfect place to hang out for a day or a week or even longer.

After the course was over, David Norman, co-owner and “Head Doughpuncher” took a few of us to his favourite BBQ joint for some brisket. Then I wanted to stay for a month, at least.

In this episode of Rise Up!, I finally have a one on one chat with David and get to learn about his journey in baking, from his earliest inspiration in Europe, through stints in Florida, Seattle and New York, before finally settling down in Texas.

We talk about mentors, about teaching and about working with partners who know their stuff. And I get a sense of what it’s like to expand into a new space and triple production.

David’s a truly nice guy and it was a thrill to talk to him. But don’t take my word for it - give it a listen!
