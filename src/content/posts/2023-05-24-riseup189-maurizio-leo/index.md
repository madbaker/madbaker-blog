Back when I was teaching baking classes at the community centre, I kept getting asked about my go-to baking resources.  There were two books that I always recommended, but when it came to sourdough bread, I added Maurizio Leo's [The Perfect Loaf](https://theperfectloaf.com) website.  It was, and remains, one of the very best resources for the sourdough baker, with information and explanation that is unparalleled.

So it was a huge thrill to have Maurizio on the podcast.  We get into it.  Baking and sourdough for sure, but also what it's like to keep a blog going for 10 years straight, before, during and after the pandemic, and be able to raise a family and write an excellent cookbook at the same time.  I get to geek out on photography and blogging a bit too.  

 Maurizio is an awesome fellow and a darn good baker.  This is a very fun conversation and I know you'll get a lot out of it.
