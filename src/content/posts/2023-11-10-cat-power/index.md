I know, I know.  It's only been two days since I moaned about streaming services [killing the album](/blog/a-modern-record-player/) in favour of singles. And then this popped up on my Tidal feed this morning:

This is ridiculously good.  Cat Power does the entire set list from this iconic concert, just like The Great Man.  The first act is acoustic; slow, quiet, powerful.  The second act is electric; soulful, rocking, joyous.  Played live as well.  The only difference is the crowd is cheering in the second act.

I've listened to the bootleg of the 1966 show dozens of times and I love it.  But this version is brilliant.  Dare I say better?  No, but it's 8pm as I write this and I've listened to this album four times through already. It's exactly what I needed today. 

I'm ashamed to say that I don't really know Cat Power and her music.  But with this album, I'm an instant fan.
