There's a big advantage to getting off the main highway and taking the back roads. We did this today, forgoing small numbered highways like 4, 2 and 3 for 310, 340 and 321.

We weren't 10 minutes from the house when we found the Little Pond Community Centre, with two sweet ladies baking inside. Twelve of the best (and cheapest) cinnamon rolls were hastily purchased, warm from the oven, along with a plate of lemon squares. Yum yum!
