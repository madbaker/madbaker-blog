I am a cheerleader for bakeries and businesses that are pillars of their community.  The place that people depend on, can rely upon, can't live without.  The business that exists to make money at the same time as they make their neighbourhoods better. 

But there is another way too. I think of it as the Travelling Circus.  These are the folks who show up once or twice a year and put on a show. 

The key with the Circus is that it has to be _amazing._  An Event with a capital E.  A happening so memorable people talk about it for weeks afterward, and get excited about long before you show up again.

The trouble exists in the middle of these two models.  You don't want to be the unreliable neighbourhood shop and put on the mediocre event.  

Better to pick one and excel. Which will you choose?
