Whenever one of the kids is listening to 'classic rock' on CD I think back to a great CBC radio show called The Great Eastern. Billed as "Newfoundland's Cultural Magazine", it was a stunning window into the culture and lifestyles of our newest province. The show ran from 1994-1999 and I absolutely loved it when it was on the air.

Thanks to the Internet, my iPod, and a fellow I only know as gporter, I'm reliving this funny part of my life through the [Great Eastern archives.](http://www.gporter.net/great/index.php) All the old episodes are there along with show notes, music playlists and other extras.

I'm listening to season 2 now but still haven't found the part with the classic rock on CD collection. It's from the end of one show where the host, Paul Moth, is comparing bland new digital recordings with the full bodied expression of an LP on coal-fired radio, using Led Zepplin's _Whole Lotta Love._ Good times, good times...

Thank you gporter, whoever you are...
