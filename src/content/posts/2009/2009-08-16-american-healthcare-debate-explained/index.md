I'm a huge fan of Dan Roam and the visual thinking techniques he taught in his book "The Back of the Napkin". I've used his techniques in several of my own presentations with very good results.

Dan's built a four part presentation explaining the current debate on health care reform that is really easy to understand. It's well worth a couple minutes to view, especially if you subscribe to any US news channels.
