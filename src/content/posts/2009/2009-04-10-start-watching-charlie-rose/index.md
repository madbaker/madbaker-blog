I don't really watch much TV and I watch even less current affairs but lately I keep been pointing me to the Charlie Rose show.   Now there's a fellow who understands how the Web works.  Or at least he seems extremely interested.

Case in point:  [Mitch Joel](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/) is really digging into how [traditional print media is dying](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/trying-to-outgoogle-google/) due to the changes brought about by the Web.  He pointed me to a recent [Charlie Rose episode](http://www.charlierose.com/view/content/10208) with the CEO of the Associated Press and Arianna Huffington, where they describe to wildy different futures for journalism and aggregators of journalism.  

My favorite Charlie Rose episode is an [interview with Marc Andreessen](http://www.charlierose.com/view/content/10093) that aired in February.  It's a rapid fire hour where Marc talks about [where the Web is at and where it's going](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/where-its-at-and-where-its-going-according-to-marc-andreessen/).  

 

Thanks to Mitch Joel for pointing me to the Andreeson interview too.  Maybe if you don't have time to watch Charlie Rose, you should just [go read Mitch's blog](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/).  He'll let you know the best stuff to watch!

\[Damn! I can't get any consistency with the embedded video. Sorry about that. Check the link to the Charlie Rose site for a larger view\]
