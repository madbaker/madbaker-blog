I'm a big fan of Lee Lefever.  He's got the knack for explaining things in a way that really makes sense.  Or as he likes to call it, Plain English.

 

He's got a new video out describing how Microsoft Sharepoint is useful.  I'm kinda forced into using Sharepoint at the day job so this helped me a lot.  It'll calm me down when I can't get the blog to work like Wordpress, or the document libraries to work like Stellent.
