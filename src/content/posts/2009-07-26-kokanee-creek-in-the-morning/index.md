[_image lost to the mists of time_]

Taken around 7:30AM. The clouds are low in the mountains because it's  
seriously humid here (north of Nelson BC). It gets hot during the day  
then big thunderstorms in the afternoon. Expecting the same today.  
So we get lots of greenery - it's a completely different ecosystem  
than the Radium-Fairmont valley on the other side of Kootenay pass.
