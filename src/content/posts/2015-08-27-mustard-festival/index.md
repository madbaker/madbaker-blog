This Sunday,  August 30 will mark Orange Boot Bakery's first appearance at the Great Saskatchewan Mustard Festival.   We're very excited to be part of this cool event.

This annual showcase of Regina's food scene, hosted by Beer Brothers and the Willow Restaurant, is a celebration of all things Mustard.  Saskatchewan is a major exporter of mustard seed so the folks at the Willow decided we better darn well be cooking with it!

Here's how the festival works:  Restaurants from all over the city (and one way cool bakery)  have tents set up with samples of delicious mustard themed dishes.  You buy a ticket for $25 and sample as much of the food as you want.  One ticket, all you can eat.  Neat!

Our baker Jennifer really, really, REALLY wanted to be part of this, so she's been working for a couple of months coming up with a special dessert with the festival.  Think it's easy to have a dessert with mustard?  Well, she pulled it off and Jen will be at the festival serving up her **Apricot Mustard Turnovers:** bite sized turnovers filled with homemade apricot jam and a hint of mustard seed.  With two tasty sauces to boot.  Yum!
