Last month we held an open house as part of _Breadville_, put on by the [Bread Bakers Guild of America.](http://bbga.org/) Guild members across the USA, Canada and Ireland held special bakery events on June 25 to celebrate local, intentional bread baking and the role of good bread within the community.

We wanted Breadville at Orange Boot to focus on our bread; what's in it and how we make it. We worked with our main ingredient suppliers, Bob Balfour at R&J Milling in Riceton and Ray Aspinall at [Daybreak Scheresky Mill](http://www.daybreakschereskymill.com/Daybreak_Mill/Organic_Mill_Info.html) near Estevan, to create a display of local grains and flours. Nicole Davis at Daybreak even brought over some pamphlets full of recipes that use their organic flours, cereals and grain mixes.

We also wanted to highlight how your bread is made, so we gave tours of the bakery. Cindy did a great job explaining how our equipment works and describing the baking process from mixing to shaping to baking. She even shared some of our stories behind how we collected the recipes we use at Orange Boot to make our classic cookies and muffins.

We suspected that some folks might like to get their hands into the dough, so Mark ran a seminar loosely titled "All About Baguettes." Ten Bootniks learned how to mix bread dough, shape baguettes and batards and slash them so they bake up pretty. It was as much fun for the instructors as the students; seminars like this are certainly something we want to do again in the future.

Jessica and Robyn took some pictures of the festivities. They did a great job capturing the fun and excitement that was Breadville at Orange Boot Bakery. Thanks to everyone who came out and made the day so much fun for us!
