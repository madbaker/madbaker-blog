I may have mentioned it 1000 times by now, but we're really thrilled by the logo and branding for the bakery. The artwork was designed by our friend and [outstanding graphic designer](http://www.zephyrcreative.ca/) Fred Reibin. Fred was playing around with the logo and the overall vibe we wanted to create and came up with this poster. Feel free to print it out and hang it anywhere and everywhere.
