For the past two weeks, Cindy has been expanding the repotoire of classic cookies and yummy muffins to add to our weekday lineup.  Just as with our bread, it's taken a while to get the quanities just right; after doubling the bakes every day for a week, she now has it so muffins and cookies are available Tuesday - Friday from the time we're open till 3:30 - 4:00PM.

 

Once we get some more pans and bowls, we might even have them right until 6PM. For now, if you simply have to get some Orange Boot sweets, either plan to stop in before 3PM or give us a call and we'll hold some for you to pick up after work.

 

Please note that we don't bake cookies and muffins on Saturday as there is too many demands on the oven for the bread schedule.  At least for now.

 

Cindy has a few more varieties to try before settling on a weekly schedule; we post the daily treats on [our facebook page]("http://facebook.com/orangebootbakery) each morning and [tweet it out]("http://twitter.com/madbaker66) during the day too.

 

Curious to know what everyone else thinks?  Here's what appears to be the most popular sweet treats at the bakery so far:

1. Classic Chocolate Chip cookies
2. Lemon Poppy Seed muffins (made with real lemons of course!)
3. Classic Oatmeal Raisin cookies
4. Banana Chocolate chip muffins

 

Although to be honest, it took a blizzard on a slow Thursday for us not to sell out, so they're all quite yummy.  Come on by Tuesday - Friday and form your own opinion!
