We are super pleased to be offering ticket to the Sheldon Williams Collegiate production of Grease. Sheldon's theatre program is one of the very best in the city and we can't wait to see this year's musical!

The show runs from November 24-26 and tickets are a super cheap $10. They also have an $8 matinee on Nov 26.

Tickets are available at the bakery.

We think Bread culture and Theatre culture go very well together. So be sure to add a couple of tickets to your bread order!
