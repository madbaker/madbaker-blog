On Tuesday, January 18, 2011, we officially opened up at our new location: [**3904 Gordon Road, Regina Saskatchewan**](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=3904+gordon+road+regina&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=3904+Gordon+Rd,+Regina,+Division+No.+6,+Saskatchewan&gl=ca&z=16).

We're starting slow: it's just Mark and Cindy baking after all. But we'll have a selection of 3-4 different loaves each day; baguettes, whole wheat boules and the always popular Orange Boot Birdseed loaf -- a sourdough multigrain loaf with lots of seeds and oats.

Over the next several weeks we'll be adding more bread, some rolls and sweet stuff too, as we get our production schedule figured out and some staff added.

We're open **Tuesday - Friday from 11AM - 6PM and Saturday from 11AM - 4PM**. At least for now.

The way it seems to be working is we have our morning bake completed and out for you by 11AM. On Fridays and Saturdays, we also do a smaller afternoon bake of baguettes and birdseed loaves that are out by 2PM. That's your two best chances at the widest selection of bread for the day.

You can reach us via phone at (306) 584-BOOT (2668) or drop us an email.

I'll leave this on the home page until we get the rest of the website tuned up.
