Got up at 4:30AM (no kidding) to catch the first of two ferries which will get us back to the Island. We left early since this is the start of the long weekend and Horseshoe Bay can get super busy.

We're giving Nanaimo another try, thanks in part to some comments on this blog. I'll be sure to report on any 'finds'...
