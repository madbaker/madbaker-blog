Let's end this summer season of Second Rise episodes with a bang.   It's time for the OG, my friend and mentor, Tracey Muzzolini, from the very first conversation on Rise Up! in 2018. ([Rise Up! #2](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-2-tracey-muzzolini))

Tracey is the co-owner of Christies Mayfair Bakery in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  It's a full on artisan bread and pastry shop, with classic Italian specialties and awesome sandwiches too.  And they also have a second location in the trendy Broadway neighbourhood offering the best Neapolitan pizza I've ever had.  

Since we had this talk, Tracey's been busy and is getting even more famous. She was a celebrity judge on the Canadian version of Wall of Bakers this spring.  And last month, Christies celebrated their 90th anniversary! 

When we dreamed of our own bakery, we wanted it to be like Tracey's place in Saskatoon.  Great food, serving her local neighbourhood, with a focus on people in general and her extended baking family in particular. 

I love Tracey so much that I'm willing to shine a light on the very first podcast interview I ever did.  I don't know if that makes me brave or stupid, but there you go.

There's lots in this talk that you're going to love.
