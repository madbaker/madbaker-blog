Yesterday I wrote about the new Bread tome called [Modernist Bread](https://www.amazon.ca/Modernist-Bread-Science-Nathan-Myhrvold/dp/0982761058/) and asked if anyone had any pull at the public library.  (Well, or with Santa Claus too.)

I sent a similar question to my Backyard Bakery buddies and it turns out that one of the Bread Buddies does in fact work at the library and close to the circulation department no less!

So the [RPL](http://reginalibrary.ca) is ordering a set of books for their collection.  Yippee!

No doubt they'll be reference material, for in library use only, but I'll gladly spend a few afternoons checking them out.  And with their excellent [province wide circulation system](https://www.sasklibraries.ca/about.html), my baking friends in Saskatoon will be able to use them too.

So the moral of the story is to actually ask for what you want, out loud.  Good things can happen.

And if you bake, make sure your librarians have access to your bread.

Now, if I could only do that with my podcast!
