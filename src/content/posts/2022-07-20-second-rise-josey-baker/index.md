When I talked with Josey Baker back in 2019 [(Rise Up! #55](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-55-josey-baker)) I wasn't sure what to expect.  He was already super famous, with a best selling book, talks at Google, and his irrepressible grin all over YouTube and Instagram.  In my mind, he was one of the early wave of 'bread celebrities.'

The Josey I spoke to was one of most thoughtful men I've ever met.  Our talk gave me the confidence to 'go there' and talk about culture, privilege and mental health.  It changed me for the better and I think you're going to love it. Listen below or at [riseuppod.com](http://riseuppod.com/second-rise-josey-baker)
