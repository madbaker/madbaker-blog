So today's my birthday and the kids decided that we _must_ head off to the bungy zone park. No, I wasn't going bungy jumping, but we were going to try out the new rage, "TreeGo." Basically, you get all harnessed up and run around the forest going through an obstacle course. Oh yeah, and you're in the air the whole time. Way up. Like 60 feet up. Crikey...

It was actually quite a bit of fun, even though I'm extremely scared of heights. There were some awesome zip lines that went way over 100 feet, some rock walls up in the trees, and all sorts of swinging bridges, board walks, ladders, etc. I didn't like the swinging logs much at all, but the rest was pretty decent. Although I need to confess that Cindy and the kids went significantly further than I did. That's OK, we all had fun and now I know who to get to roof the house later.

Thanks to John and the folks at Wild Play in Nanaimo for a really fun afternoon!
