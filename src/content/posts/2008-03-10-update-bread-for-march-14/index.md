Hello everyone,

It was great to get back into the swing of things, baking for all of you in the brick oven. The new bread formulas are translating fairly well to our Saskatchewan flour and the Orange Boot mixer, so this week we're modifying one of our regular loaves and introducing a brand new loaf too.

Apologies all around for the bluff about the Baguettes last week. The new loaves have a different fermentation schedule so it's going to take a while to fine tune our schedules. We simply ran out of time and temperature to get the baguettes done by 3PM. We won't promise them yet, but we'll try to surprise you one week soon.

This week's bread:

**Saskatchewan Sourdough** Our sourdough culture is strong and flavourful so it's time to try it out with some new fermentation techniques. Our starter gives a very light sour undertone so you can enjoy the flavour of the wheat.

- Saskatchewan Sourdough, 600g loaf, $3.50

**Flax Seed Bread** Flax is all the rage these days with people expounding on their health benefits. All I know for sure is they taste pretty good in our bread! This free-form loaf contains several flours, lots of flax seeds and some currants for a sweet touch too. A real treat for fans of whole grains.

- Flax Seed Bread, 500g +/- loaf, $3.50

As is our custom, please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling us at 522-1592. Your bread can be picked up between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, March 14.

Best wishes this week!
