Grey day this morning (day 2 of the BBGA German Baking course) but the skyline is still pretty, especially with the green turf of the SAIT soccer pitch.

Lots of changes in Calgary, as usual. Lots more condos downtown, to go with all the office towers. From the northwest, Calgary Tower is nowhere to be seen.
