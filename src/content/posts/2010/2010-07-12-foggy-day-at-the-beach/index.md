When you're retracing your steps from five years ago, you just have to go for it, no matter what the weather. Today that meant a trip to Marguerite Beach on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. It's a beautiful white sand beach that just screams out for playing in the surf.

We did just that - fog or no fog - and had a great time. The water was absolutely freezing, but that's what the Atlantic is all about!

It was a great day that we topped off the same way as our first trip - fish and chips and a lobster roll at the little red shack at the side of the road at Musquodoboit Harbour. Yay!
