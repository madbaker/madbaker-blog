[Prairie Dog Magazine](http://www.prairiedogmag.com/) is once again holding their ['Best of Food' Reader Poll](http://prairedogmag.secondstreetapp.com/l/Best-of-Food-2015/Welcome) and we'd really love to get nominated once again as the Best Bakery in Regina. We've been very fortunate to win "Best Bakery" three of the past four years and it's really helped us get the word out about what we are doing at Orange Boot Bakery.

Whenever Cindy and I are travelling, we always check out the local "Best of" surveys to find out what local folks love in their community.  The [Planet S Best of Food poll](http://www.planetsmag.com/bestfood) is our go-to resource when we're in Saskatoon.  We found the most [amazing Italian restaurant in Vancouver](http://nookrestaurant.ca/) and a [killer breakfast in Victoria](http://www.shinecafe.ca/) the same way.

The Prairie Dog poll is unique because it's the only thing of its kind in Regina that is reader driven, rather than paid for by the restaurant / vendor.  When we first opened I was surprised just how many of these "Best of" features were really just paid ads.  But the Prairie Dog results are actual votes from real people.

Now, their new process is a little convoluted.  There are two rounds:  nominations and then more voting.   All votes between now and March 26 are nominations -- you write in whoever you like. After March 26, only the top three in each category will show up for further votes.  So we really need some votes over the next couple of days to make sure we're in the top 3, then more votes after that to get to #1.

The good news!  You only have to do this once (nominations carry over as final votes) and you can win a great prize if you vote in more than 20 categories.

So please vote for your favourite places in town so I know where to go eat when I'm not baking.  And if you write in Orange Boot Bakery as "Best Bakery" and even "Best Cinnamon Bun" and "Best Muffin" well, that would be awesome.

[Vote now!](http://prairedogmag.secondstreetapp.com/l/Best-of-Food-2015/Ballot/ShoppingampServices)  **Nominations close March 26!**
