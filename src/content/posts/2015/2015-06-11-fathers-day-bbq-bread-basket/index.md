Just wanted to mention that Father's Day is right around the corner.  Right, like the fifty pounds of Father's Day flyers wasn't enough of a heads up!

I know that all the flyers this week are chock full of 'The Perfect Father's Day Accessories' like Bluetooth enabled golf balls, retro shave gear and "Kiss the Cook" aprons.  Ugh.  But we both know that all you really need for a perfect Father's Day  is a nice afternoon to hang out with your loved ones and maybe something to nibble on.

We've got you covered in the nibbles department.  Once again we have designed a unique, limited edition, hand crafted collection of bread and baked goods that screams Awesome, just like your Dad.

We call it the **Father's Day BBQ Basket**.  Here’s what we have in store for you:

- First up is our “once a year only” **Bacon and Cheddar Sourdough Loaf**. We’re heading down to Butcher Boy Meats for some of their best smoked bacon, grating up two year old aged white cheddar cheese and adding both to our sublime Saskatchewan Sourdough loaf. We only make it once a year because once we roast up seven pounds of bacon nobody wants to work anymore - we just want to eat;

- Then we’re adding a selection of **our best BBQ Buns**. Onion Poppy Seed, Cheese Buns and Sesame Burger buns. Each are amazing on their own, but together they are guaranteed to cause a few arguments when it's time to plate up;

- We’re also adding a six pack of **Herbed Tomato and Asiago Buns**. These are soft, moist morsels that will be great with a tiny burger or pulled pork or just for snacking on while you cook;

- Also included is a bottle of our must have BBQ condiment, from our favourite Regian rib joint, voted Best BBQ in town, **Jack Keaton’s Original BBQ Sauce;**

- And finally, for dessert, we're including **four Fruit Turnovers.** Delicious, flaky, fresh fruit mini pies you can eat with your hand.  Yum!

As with all our special baskets, quantities are very limited.  We only have room for so much bread in the oven and so many baskets in our tiny shop.

Each Father's Day BBQ Basket is $45.  This year **we will be making 40 Baskets on Saturday June 20** and we will sell out. So please order your basket as soon as possible. Don't miss out!

There are two easy ways to order your basket:  either call the bakery at (306) 584-2668 or use the easy order form below.

PS - All baskets will be ready for pickup **by noon** on Saturday June 20.
