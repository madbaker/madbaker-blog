One of the coolest things about Summertime is meeting people who are visiting Regina.  There have been quite a few people come into the bakery over the past week or so and, after picking up some fresh bread and a cookie or two, the conversation usually ends up with the question "What are some other cool eating spots in Regina?"

We should likely print up a reference card to hand out when we get these questions, but in the meantime, here's a quick list of Mark and Cindy's favourite Regina restaurants.   The only criteria are:

- they are independent local restaurants (no chains here!)
- Mark and Cindy eat here often and can't wait to go back

Even if you're from town, give these places a try this summer!

### Daisy's Pantry (General Hospital Neighbourhood)

This is our current go-to light lunch spot.  [Daisy's Pantry](http://daisyspantry.ca/) is a tiny, eclectic breakfast and lunch place with super fresh and interesting food. Darla (owner, host and cook) offers up a very limited but extremely tasty menu. Limited as in one sandwich and one salad, which changes day to day.

What we like most is that Darla makes Real Food.  A darn good chicken salad wrap with real chicken and lots of interesting additions.  Real, honest soup.  We've not had a meal here we didn't love.

### Bushwakker Brewpub (Warehouse District)

When Cindy and I want pub grub, we head to [Bushwakker](http://www.bushwakker.com/).  We love the old wood decor, the buzz at lunch hour and (of course) the food.

Bushwakker is known for their burgers, their Saskatchewan Plate (perogies, cabbage rolls, sausage) and their humongous nacho platters. But lately Cindy and I have been enjoying the taco salad - a large salad with lots of tomatoes, avocados and black beans, with a spicy meat skewer and salsa too.  Delicious!

### Jack Keaton's BBQ and Grill (North End)

If a light lunch isn't going to cut it after our baking shift, we head up north to [Jack Keaton's](http://www.jackkeatons.com/) for a BBQ Brunch.  They have the best "low and slow" ribs and their Southern Fried Chicken is awesome.  I really like their homemade Mac and Cheese for a side dish too.

### [La Cucaracha Cocina Mexicana](https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Cucaracha-Cocina-Mexicana/193757647338837) (Cathedral Area)

This tiny walk up food stand on 13th Avenue is a real gem, although they are only open on weekdays and only during the warm months so plan ahead!  We've been caught out on Saturday and Sunday quite a bit, but when we remember to head over for a taco or two we never regret it.

### Fresh and Sweet (Downtown)

If we've got a hankering for Sunday Breakfast, Cindy and I will walk downtown to [Fresh and Sweet](http://www.valleygirlscatering.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8&Itemid=3).  It's always hopping, there's usually a wait, but we don't mind.  It's fun to see what the cool kids are wearing, compare tattoos and have someone else cook our eggs.

 

There you have it.  Mark and Cindy's favourite Regina restaurants.  We've got you covered Monday - Sunday, breakfast, lunch and supper.  If you haven't been, give them a try.  Maybe we'll see you there!
