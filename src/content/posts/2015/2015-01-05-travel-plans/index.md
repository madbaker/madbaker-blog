Cindy and I are heading off to Victoria for a few days later this week for a rest and some warmer weather.  It was -33C this morning so even rainy and +6C will feel pretty darn nice.  And we get to visit with our great friend Renee.  AND, it's off-season, so we got a suite in the lovely [Oswego Hotel](http://oswegovictoria.com/) in James Bay for barely half what the Super 8 in Estevan costs these days.  Lovely.

I enjoy these little mid-winter getaways.  Victoria is a lovely city to walk in -- lots of coffee shops, the [best used bookstore ever](http://www.russellbooks.com/), and some fine [restaurants](http://pizzeriaprimastrada.com/) and [bakeries](http://bubbyrosesbakery.com/).  Great breakfasts too.    But my highlight will be getting to visit [Fry's Bakery](http://www.frysbakery.com/) when they are open!

The past two times I've been to Victoria, Byron has been closed.  We bakers seem to take a break at the same time.  But I checked and he's open this weekend.  I've already sent an email offering to tote flour and do dishes one night so I can watch him do his thing.  I hope he's up for some company!  If he agrees I'll be sure to have a full report on the Orange Boot blog.

It's entirely possible this is my only trip this year, unless the Bread Bakers Guild is going to offer a class I can't refuse.  The next vacation I want to take is Paris, and that's going to take some saving and planning.  Spring 2016 is my best guess for that one.

Having typed that though, I can't imagine staying here all year.  Camping maybe? That would be nice...
