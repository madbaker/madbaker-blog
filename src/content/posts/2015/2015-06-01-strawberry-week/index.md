St. Paul's Church had their annual Strawberry Fair on May 30 and Ben was #3 in line to pick up three flats of beautiful fresh strawberries.  We're slicing, dicing, cooking and folding them into some special baking this week only (**Tuesday June 2 - Saturday June 6)** and are calling the entire affair **Strawberry Week!**

- We'll have **Strawberry Muffins** all week long, featuring fresh strawberries of course;
  
- Robyn and Jennifer are making up a bunch of **Strawberry Rhubarb Turnovers**this week too. You can call them **hand pies** if you like.
  
- Jennifer has also been working on a scrumptious Vanilla Cake recipe so we'll have special **Vanilla cupcakes filled with strawberry curd** and topped with a delicious**real strawberry icing.**

- And Cindy promises me that on **Friday we'll also be making Chocolate Cupcakes** with strawberry filling and icing.

Cupcakes at Orange Boot??  I know!!   Well, we weren't going to make them until they were awesome, and these are awesome.  They're so good I don't really want to tell you about them so I can have more for myself. But Cindy has this "rule" about "guests" and stuff so I'm not allowed near the cupcake area.  Sigh...
