Back in February we launched our annual True Friends Contest, where we gave away three pass along gift baskets.

The way the contest works is that the winners can enjoy a basket full of bread and goodies then pass it along to their  best friend, who can bring the basket back to the bakery for a free refill.  The baskets can get passed along from best friend to best friend for an entire year.

That's how it _works_, but the _point_ of the contest is to celebrate friendships.  We love how the baskets give the lucky holders a chance to give a cool gift to their best friend, for free.

We really hope the baskets get used a lot.  We're hoping to set a new record this year by filling over 100 baskets.  And so far, we're right on track.  At last count we've filled over 45 baskets.  That's a lot of happy friends.

Most of the time we see the baskets two or three times per week, although, sadly, one basket has gone missing for quite a few weeks now.  We hope it comes back for a visit soon.

When a basket comes back, we ask for a picture of the lucky friend for our Wall of Fame.  We're adding pictures all the time - check it out next time you're at Orange Boot!
