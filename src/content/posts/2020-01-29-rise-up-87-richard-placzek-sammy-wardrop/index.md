I got a hot tip several weeks back that I really needed to check out [Whole Grain Hearth](https://thewholegrainhearth.ca) in London (Ontario.) Not only were they making some super awesome whole grain bread and pastries, but they were also fans of the podcast. What could possibly go wrong?

Well…nothing really. Richard Placzek and his pastry chef / manager Sammy Wardrop are doing great things in the London market scene, with a focus on fresh milled, whole grain flour.

This is a partnership that totally works, but the bakery didn’t start as a partnership. We talk about how Richard and Sammy found each other, how they built up the business and what they plan to do next.

We also walk down the long and winding road that was Richard’s breaducation. He’s worked with some legends and we talk about that too.

Enjoy the show!
