We pulled into the Day Use area just outside Victoria, PEI to cool off and enjoy all those things we love about this province - the red beaches, warm water, blue skies and the verdant green grass and farms.

It may be 25C and muggy in town, but out here there's a cool breeze to keep me happy. The beach full of snails keep Robyn happy too!
