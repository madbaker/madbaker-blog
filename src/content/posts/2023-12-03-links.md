I got all full of words yesterday and forgot that Saturday is my day for links of the week.  Please forgive me.  Here's the best things I read this week:

- First off, I need to give a shout out to Anh and her gorgeous, hand drawn website [Comic Anhs](https://anhvn.com/).  Anh is a huge inspiration; I try to have a similar introspective whimsy here even if I don't have anywhere near her talent;

- The story of the week for me was this post explaining why [Duke University Libraries is dropping Basecamp](https://blogs.library.duke.edu/blog/2023/11/30/why-were-dropping-basecamp/).  I dropped my hey.com account last year on principle, although I knew the overall impact was less than tilting at a windmill.  But this is a much bigger deal, and the article explaining the decision is clear and enlightened and awesome. (via [roytang.net](https://roytang.net) and others);

- Interview of the week was Neil Gaiman predicting a future thick with a return personal websites and blogging.  Please, please, pretty please! Here's Cal Newport's take on the interview: [Neil Gaimanâ€™s Radical Vision for the Future of the Internet](https://calnewport.com/neil-gaimans-radical-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/);
  
- The amazing folks who publish a daily 'generally approachable' sudoku puzzle on Discord now have a website with all their puzzle archives!  [Generally Approachable Sudoku](https://sudokutheory.com/gas/);

- Russell Davies found a line from a New Yorker article that is a great formula to achieve unstuckness: [Problem + metaphor = presentation](https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2023/11/problem-metaphor-presentation.html);

- Winnie Lim has a deep, thoughtful personal blog and is also an exceptional travel writer.  I want to go to Tokyo so bad after reading [creative retail experiences and warmth in Tokyo](https://winnielim.org/journal/creative-retail-experiences-and-warmth-in-tokyo/);

- And I'm still laughing hard at McSweeney's.  This week it was [Your Amazon Order of Reusable Metal Straws Is Currently on Its Way Via the Most Ecologically Devastating Route You Could Imagine](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/your-amazon-order-of-reusable-metal-straws-is-currently-on-its-way-via-the-most-ecologically-devastating-route-you-could-imagine).
