The new Schedule's here!  The new Schedule is here!

Over the past three months, the entire Orange Boot crew has been working hard coming up with new recipes for bread and sweets.  In fact, there have been so many changes that some of you started getting confused over what to expect at the bakery every day.  So we built a new schedule for you, so you can plan your baking week.

Some highlights:

- New muffins, including two whole grain muffins
- New specialty bread on Friday and Saturday (now with Spelt!)
- Summertime burger buns every single day
- and a whole new category we call Sweet Extras.  Scones, Bread Pudding, mini-loaves and more!

Our attractive schedule, in classic black and white, makes a perfect accompaniment to any fridge magnet.  Get yours now!
