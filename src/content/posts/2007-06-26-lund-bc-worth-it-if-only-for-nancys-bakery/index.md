This may well be the best bakery I've ever been to. The bread is good but not the best (Christies in Saskatoon is still #1) but the pastries, the lunches, the friendly staff and the amazing views are unbelievable.

You might think it crazy to drive 50km down a somewhat paved, very twisty road to visit a bakery, but this one is worth it.

It is as good as the Okeover campground is bad. Helln it's even better, and that's saying something.

I have some pics but they will need to wait till I get home.
