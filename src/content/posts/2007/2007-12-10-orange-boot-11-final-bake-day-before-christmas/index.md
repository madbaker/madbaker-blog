We hope you’re having a great December so far. Things have been really busy for us – Robyn got over her flu bug, a little hockey was played and we’re getting used to the fact that it’s going to be really, really cold for some time yet. But nothing beats the cold like a wood fire and fresh bread, so we’re back baking this week!

Please note: This Friday will be the last baking day for us before Christmas –- we’re frantically trying to get our head around leasing a commercial space in the New Year (more details below) and we need to get some shopping done too.

This Week: Many of your old favourites -- order some extra to freeze if you need. All the loaves freeze well; the multigrain especially so.

#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large sandwich loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!

- Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00

#2: Our “birdseed” loaf is a multi-grain loaf chock-full of roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds. The seeds add extra crunchiness and pack a lot of flavour!

- Orange Boot Birdseed Bread, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00

#3: There’s nothing ordinary about our _Pain Ordinaire_ - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.

- French Loaf (_Pain Ordinaire_), 700g Batard, $3.50

#4 (Sweet Special): Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread. This is a very pretty sweet loaf, with six strands of dough all braided together and baked till a golden brown. A luxurious treat with a hint of oranges and as many cranberries and nuts as we can cram in there!

- Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread, 850g Braided Loaf, $7.00

Note: If you’ve got a large gathering, we’d be glad to make a 1.2kg behemoth for you for $9.00.

#5 (Savory Special): Herb and Garlic Focaccia. This amazing flatbread is built over two days for maximum flavour and then we go even further with a home-made herb oil. Wow! This is sold as a slab which you can cut up for guests or tear apart with gusto.

- Orange Boot Herb Focaccia, 8”x12” slab, $4.00

As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.

We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don't hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.

Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn

=== What's Happening at the Orange Boot? ===

It looks like we might be going “legit” sooner than we thought. An opportunity came up to take over a local bake shop and we’re seriously considering going for it. Lots of details to work out – negotiations, financing, equipment appraisals, staffing, renovations to plan, etc. and we’re trying to get a final decision made before Christmas. Exciting and scary all at once.

Mark is also enrolling in an Artisan Bread baking course at the San Francisco Baking Institute in early 2008 so we can offer up some new and interesting varieties for you to try.

As if that wasn’t enough, Mark’s researching some new whole grain breads to give you some even healthier alternatives. More news to come in the New Year on this topic too.
