Some final cool tidbits from the 43folders podcast with David Allen:

-On committing to your organization process: either your head is your organization system, or it's not. David obviously recommends against using your head, but if you're going to start getting things out of your head, you've got to get everything out. As soon as you track two items in your head you'll distrust your other system.

- Merlin Mann likes using the phrase 'Ninja Moves' for really cool techniques. I like that.

- organization is like training kids and dogs: use as few rules as possible but never break them. HUGE head nods after everything we've done training Buddy Dog.

- if you can't do it (organize) with paper, you can't do it with 'e'. You're going to get paper, and you're going to get emails. if you can't deal with both you're in trouble.

- one crazy, step back from the ledge thought: what if I set up my email / blackberry to only push emails every two hours? Would I get more done? *whew* I need to sit down....
