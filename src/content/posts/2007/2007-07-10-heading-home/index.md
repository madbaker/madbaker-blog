Writing this post from the waiting area in the Victoria airport. Anothe sunny calm morning - I'm going to miss these excellent mornings...

This was a great trip. Great sites, super adventures and really, really relaxing. Vancouver Island has a lot to offer, and the laid back attitude is a very important part of life here. We're going to do everything we can to bring this attitude back to Regina. We've been blessed with very livable cities here - cities that remain about people rather than cars. I'm ready to recommit to moving Regina further in this direction - whether that's local markets, bike lanes, or better public transportation. I don't want to move, but I don't want to have to drive everywhere either.

Let's see how this new mood holds up when I go to work tomorrow...
