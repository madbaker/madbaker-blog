I say it all the time: there’s something special about talking with bakers. And if you don’t believe me, spend a few minutes talking with Sarah Rossi and you’ll be convinced that I’m right.

I met Sarah at WheatStalk 2018 when I held my breath and crashed her table in the lunch room. And am I ever glad I did. She’s not only friendly, bright and articulate, but she has a deep love for her profession.

Sarah is a bread baker at the popular and famous Clear Flour Bread in Brookline, Mass., which is across the street from Boston and across the river from Cambridge. But Sarah was born and raised in neighbouring New Hampshire. Earlier this year, Sarah and her husband moved to Dover, NH but she continues to make the good stuff at Clear Flour. Even though that means a 90 minute commute each way. 90 minutes!

In this episode of Rise Up! we talk about growing up in New Hampshire, college life and the journey that brought her to Boston. We also talk about life as a working baker and what the future holds now that she’s back in her home state. It’s a great chat and I’m so glad we can share it with you.
