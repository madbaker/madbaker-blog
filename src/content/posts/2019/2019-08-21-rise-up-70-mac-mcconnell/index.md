To those of us who love baking school, Mac McConnell was best known as the Artisan Bread instructor at the San Francisco Baking Institute. (You can see him in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEG1BjWroT0).) But these days he’s rocking out the bread and pastries at his own bakery, The Midwife and the Baker in Mountain View, California.

Mac is making the good stuff, for sure. Amazing sourdough loaves with fresh milled flour and awesome pastries that you can find at the farmer’s market or at many cafes throughout the Bay Area. But he’s still testing and tweaking and trying his best to unlock the mysteries of great bread.

Our fun chat goes all over the place, from his start as an engineer to apprenticing and some of the best bakeries in the USA, to getting the call to teach and SFBI. Then he gets my jaw to drop when he starts talking about how he had to grow like crazy to meet the needs of his cafe customers. Wow did I ever learn a ton. I hope you will too.
