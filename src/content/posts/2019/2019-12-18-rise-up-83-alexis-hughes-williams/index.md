In the final podcast before the Holidays, I chat with a woman who is bringing the sweet stuff to the people of Nashville, Tennessee. And Alexis Hughes-Williams is doing so much more too.

We talk about all the things - from growing up in Wisconsin, to the pros and cons of starting [Something Sweet](https://www.somethingsweetllc.com/) via pop-ups, to her plans for national expansion thanks to her large, well dispersed family. It was so great to hear about how Alexis is bringing her great-grandmaâ€™s recipes to live through her bakery.

And yet, even with all the tasty treats, Alexis is also running a non-profit organization that encourages and empowers young women called [Girl unKnown](https://www.girlunknown.org/). We talk about the balancing act that requires as well.

All that, a Christmas story, a [Bakers4Bakers](https://bakers4bakers.org) update and the launch of the [Rise Up! Volunteer Supporter](https://donorbox.org/riseuppod) program too. This show is as jam packed as a Holiday cookie box!
