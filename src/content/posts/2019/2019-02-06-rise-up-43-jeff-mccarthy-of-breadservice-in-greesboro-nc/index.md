Jeff McCarthy is bringing the good stuff to the people of Greensboro, North Carolina while balancing life as a stay at home dad, which is pretty darn remarkable. He’s finished his first market season and is getting a subscription business going to boot.

Although Jeff is fairly new to bread production, he’s an old hand in the food world, having trained as a pastry chef and worked in big and small kitchens (though not as small as his home kitchen!)

In this episode, I get the scoop on Jeff’s journey in baking and in life and we take a really good run at why exactly we do what we do.

Plus, there are answers to our last Question of the Week and a brand new question too. So come on now - you gotta hear this one!
