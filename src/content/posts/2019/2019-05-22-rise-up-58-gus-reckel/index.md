When I was at WheatStalk last year, I kept seeing this tall, slim baker with a great bushy beard. Even though we weren’t in a class together he kept popping up all over the conference.

Then, when I got home, my Instagram feed kept recommending a bakery in New York called [L’Imprimerie](https://limprimerie.nyc/), with a logo featuring that same bushy beard. Was this “Monsieur Gus” the same baker? Yup!

His bread looked great and I wanted to meet him, so I reached out to Gus Reckel late last year. What followed was a series of missed appointments that were 100% my fault, including not one but two botched ‘in person’ meetups at his bakery. But I’m thrilled that we finally got together to meet each other and have a truly awesome chat.

In this episode, we talk about how Gus left a successful career as an investment banker to open his own French bakery in Brooklyn. I get to learn about how the connection with his local community is paramount, even as he gets more famous thanks in no small part to a massively popular, [award winning video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGbNI26PPYg) that features Gus and his bakery. And we also talk about his gorgeous, funny and irreverent Instagram page, which is loved by many, but not his mother.
