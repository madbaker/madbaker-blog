When people find out you are a baker and you have a podcast, strange things start to happen. Often it starts as a question: “You know who you should talk to?”

That happened a few weeks ago when my new friend Gillian told me about her friend Elizabeth Belkind. All she told me was that Elizabeth was a pastry chef and owner of a place called Cake Monkey.

Cake Monkey? That name was reason enough to reach out to Elizabeth. And was I ever glad I did!

Not only does Elizabeth and her team make the most delightful miniature cakes and delicious breakfast pastries, but she’s had a long and fruitful career working with some of the best chefs in the business. And her life before baking? Well, you’ll just have to listen to find out. No way you guess this story!

I am so thrilled for the serendipity that can arise from telling people what I do all day. And I’m doubly, triply thrilled that I got to meet Elizabeth Belkind and share her amazing story with you. This is a special talk, for sure. Enjoy!
