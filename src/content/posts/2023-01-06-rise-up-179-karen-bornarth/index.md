Ahead of the launch of a new season of the [Rise Up! podcast](https://riseuppod.com) next week, it’s well worth having a listen to the final episode of 2022, where I talk to Karen Bornarth, the new Executive Director of the [Bread Bakers Guild of America](https://bbga.org).

Karen has been an active part of the American bread scene for over two decades, and in this episode, she shares her baking story, from late nights at Amy's Breads to her baking and education work at Hot Bread Kitchen. 

Since accepting her new role at the Guild last July, Karen has been listening to members across the USA, getting a sense of where the Guild needs to change. The BBGA celebrates their 30th anniversary this year and during our conversation one gets the sense of where the Guild is headed for their next 30 years.

It’s a fun conversation, with plenty of inspiration for bakers and bakery owners, no matter where you live. Listen below or over at [riseuppod.com](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-179-karen-bornarth)
