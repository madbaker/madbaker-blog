In last weekend's newsletter, I told the story of making soup and bread for Cindy's staff lunch.  I waxed rhapsodic about the amazing Mediterranean Lentil Soup recipe from our former baker [Sandy Hammond](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MerryLittleBreezeMLB), and how the recipe was featured on cards that customers could take home from Orange Boot Bakery (hopefully with a flatbread that complemented the soup!)

Of course, requests for the recipe came in within minutes.  So here it is.^[If you prefer a PDF copy, [click here](/docs/sandys-soup.pdf)]  Give it a try; it's as delicious as it is simple.  Just a few ingredients and lots of love.
