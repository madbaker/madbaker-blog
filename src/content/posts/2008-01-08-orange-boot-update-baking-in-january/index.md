Hello Bread Lovers!

The weather has warmed up a bit and we've found a source of seasoned firewood, so we're back to baking this week!

As we're getting back into the swing of things, we'll be sticking to two of your favorites this week:

#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!

Please note: We're no longer making sandwich loaves in the brick oven. You'll get the same great flavour in an oblong shape -- it's still a nice high loaf which is great for your morning toast.

#2: There's nothing ordinary about our _Pain Ordinaire_ - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise starting Thursday night to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.

Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.

Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn
