It was a stormy, blustery Saturday morning so I had a leisurely lie-about in the apartment. Tried to get caught up on my reading but that is a fool's errand.  My blog feed reader is now up to 1650 unread posts, more than I could possibly read, so I did what any normal person would do: I added a few more blogs to the feed.

Lots of noteworthy writers and writing today. Here are the highlights:

- Let's start with some optimism.  [Rueben Schade](https://rubenerd.com/) made me smile with a list of [Popular Opinions](https://rubenerd.com/my-popular-opinions-part-2/). As usually happens with Rueben's blog, I got caught up on all of his latest posts before moving on.  I think I'd quite like him if we met in real life.

- [David Moldawer](https://mavengame.com/)'s Saturday newsletter was a treat, as usual.  David writes about writing, but more often than not, he shares personal stories about those critical traits all writers need - resilience and perseverance.

- All the cool kids are listing their [default applications](https://defaults.rknight.me/) this week, based on a podcast that is now on my listening feed.  Alas, most of them are Mac folk, so it doesn't translate, but the aforementioned [Rueben](https://rubenerd.com/my-default-applications/) is a FreeBSD fellow so I spent a while digging into all sorts of open source alternatives to my Windows apps.  Thanks, Rueben.

- Ernie Smith's [Tedium](https://tedium.co/) blog is a darn near perfect balance of tech nostalgia, insights and snark.  I love it.  And as someone who is trying to get perfect 100 Lighthouse scores on this website, the [Jell-o in a Sack](https://tedium.co/2023/11/08/core-web-vitals-google-criticism/) post hit a perfect bullseye.

- You'll not find a more minimal blog than [This Day's Portion](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/).  And every post I read is a direct hit for the developer wannabe in me.  This post on [how he documented his blog's style sheet](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/notes/2023-11-11-external-stylesheets/) is exactly what I needed as I try to make this site look fresh, clean and crisp.

- [Eleventy hit seven million downloads](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/seven-million/)!  That's how I power this site and I'm glad I'm not alone.
  
- And don't worry if all this web development stuff leaves you cold.  Here's a good old manual typewriter post.  Well, sort of.  [Free 'Patrician' font based on a Royal Standard typewriter](https://writingball.blogspot.com/2023/11/free-typewriter-font-patrician.html).
