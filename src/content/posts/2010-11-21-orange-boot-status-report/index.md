An email went out to the Bootniks today with an update on the bakery.   There's a short form for the veterans21 and a longer email for the hundreds of subscribers who joined the Bootnik list in the past two weeks.   I also shot a brief video walkthrough of the space, which should be appearing below.  Enjoy!

Lots of work to go on the bakery itself along with this website.  If there are any Wordpress developers out there looking to do some _pro-bono_ (or nearly so, or in exchange for bread) work to earn the unending praise of Regina bread lovers, please fire me an email!
