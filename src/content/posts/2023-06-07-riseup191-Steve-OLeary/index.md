Steve O'Leary is no stranger to restaurants and kitchens, but it took the Covid lockdown for Steve to find his groove in bread baking.  The bread bug bit him hard, however, and his bakery, Black Market Bakers has grown by leaps and bounds.

This was a moving conversation, as we shifted from the business journey, from a food truck to retail location in a few short years, to a deeper discussion of family in business.  Steve built this bakery with his dad and brothers, all veteran restauranteurs, and they put a lot of work into building a strong team.  People matter to Steve and it comes through loud and clear in this talk.

This episode received a lot of positive feedback in the days after it shipped.  Well worth a listen.
