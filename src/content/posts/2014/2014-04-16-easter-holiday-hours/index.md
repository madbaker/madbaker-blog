Easter Sunday is April 20, snow or no snow.  (I’m hoping for no snow.)  With the Good Friday holiday, our hours have changed a bit this week.

We’re open as usual Thursday, April 17, 9:30AM – 6PM

We are CLOSED on Good Friday, April 18.

We are open on Saturday, April 19, 9:30AM – 4PM.

Even though we’re closed for a day, the bakers will be working all day and all night to get ready for our two busiest days of the year.  The Thursday and Saturday before Easter really put stress on our tiny oven, trying to get the hundreds of Easter Braids, Hot Cross Buns and Easter Egg Sugar Cookies baked for you, along with our regular bread, pastries and sweets. 

So please forgive us if we look weary instead of cheery this week. We still love to see you and have a chat, but we may have to keep our hands moving at the same time!
