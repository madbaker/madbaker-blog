After a year away, it’s time to bring back a huge favourite, the **Pear Buckwheat Loaf** as our Bread of the Month for October.  

We love everything about this loaf.  First, we get to use hard to find local,  organic Buckwheat Flour from [Daybreak Mill](http://www.daybreakmill.com/) in Estevan.  Then we take dried pears (shipped in from Winnipeg), chop them up and soak them in white wine (from BC, via the Liquor Board store.)   Then we mix up a slow rising bread dough, let it sit for a good long time, shape them and bake them.

We do everything we can to remind everyone that it’s a special loaf, worthy of a place on your table.  We shape it like a pear, then stencil a pear on it as another reminder.   The result is a gorgeous loaf that is fit for the center of your Thanksgiving table and tastes just as good. 

The **Pear Buckwheat Loaf** is available every day in October and then it’s gone for another year.  It’s also our special Thanksgiving loaf – we’ll be making lots of them this weekend for your Thanksgiving feast.

**One Note:** In order to fit these loaves in the oven each morning, **we are putting the 24 hour sourdough on hiatus for a while.** We won’t be making any of them this week, and will move the 24 hour sourdough to a once-per-week loaf beginning October 15.  We still haven’t picked the date so let us know if you have a preference.
