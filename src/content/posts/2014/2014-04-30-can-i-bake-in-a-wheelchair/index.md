When the Canadian Paraplegic Association became our new neighbours last year I started to think a lot more about the challenges of living and working in a wheelchair.  Those cracks in our sidewalks looked bigger.  So did the potholes in our parking lot and our "blowin' in the wind" front door.   So when Sheila asked me to be a [Chair Leader](http://www.spinalcordinjurysask.com/news/chair-leader-event/) on May 7, I said Yes right away.  I want to show just how much I can (or can't) accomplish in a normal baking shift.

- Can I reach the bench to shape dough?
- Can I load the oven?  Do dishes?
- What if I'm a customer?  Can I actually navigate the new ramp our landlord put in last summer?  Can I make it along the sidewalk?
- I usually have a delivery to make on Wednesdays.  How is that going to work?

Oh dear.  This really will be a challenge.

But that's the point of the whole event.  To raise awareness of what people with spinal cord injuries have to deal with every day.  And to shine a light on what needs to be fixed so everyone can get around barrier free.

So come see how I do on the morning of May 7.  But more importantly, **[please donate now](http://sci.akaraisin.com/chairleaders2014SK/orangebootbakery).** I know I'm going to screw up lots and find a hundred things that need fixing.  And there's a thousand other things that need fixing around Saskatchewan to make the province more accessible.  That's what the Paraplegic Association does -- they help people with spinal cord injuries find accessible housing, get to work, and work in accessible workplaces.  **Your donation will help the CPA provide even more services to folks right here in Saskatchewan.** Tell your friends that you helped us out and get them to help us out too.  Tweet, Facebook, Tumble or Stumble.  Come Snapchat or Instagram or Pin as I struggle through a bake shift.  Whatever it takes.  But **[donate now](http://sci.akaraisin.com/chairleaders2014SK/orangebootbakery)**.  Thanks.
