## A Riff on Sunk Costs and Stealing Like an Artist

A few weeks ago, I was visiting my friends [Sharron and Shannon](https://www.facebook.com/Magpies-Kitchen-160923457284959/) when talk turned to Pop Up shops. You know, those temporary shops that spring up in a vacant space for one or two days and then disappear.

After some casual complaining about these popper-uppers not having to deal with the overhead of leases and equipment, etc, I started to wonder a bit more about our complaining. How bad is all this overhead, really? How stuck are we? And is there anything we can learn from these pop-ups when they, well, pop into our neighbourhoods.

[In this episode of Rise Up! The Baker Podcast](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-38-the-popupcast-thoughts-about-sunk-costs-and-stealing-like-an-artist), itâ€™s all about pop ups and what we can learn from them And how we can think of our past decisions in a new light too. Enjoy!
