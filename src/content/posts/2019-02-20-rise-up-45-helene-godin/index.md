When Helene Godin left her law career, she dreamed of opening a cute bakery that served her local community in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.  And she did that, at least for a little while.

By The Way Bakery now has four locations in New York and is in over 40 Whole Foods Markets. 

Oh, and _By The Way,_ everything Helene makes is gluten free, dairy free and kosher!

Talking to Helene has been a dream of mine ever since I first heard of her bakery 6 or 7 years ago. What do I know about gluten free baking? What was it like to design a bakery where you’re not baking every day, right from the start? And how does one go about getting into Whole Foods anyway?

In this episode of the Rise Up! podcast, we talk about all of that and a lot more. And we spend a lot of time discussing how the community connection is still important even when you grow into a larger operation.
