Hi everyone,

The garage is put back together and the yard is dry-ish so we're back to baking this week. I'm really excited about working in a brighter, fresher looking space -- I hope you are able to come check it out this week!

Two loaves are on offer this week:

#1: Orange Boot Birdseed Bread: A very popular multigrain loaf with roasted sunflower and sesame seeds, rolled oats and flax seeds. Great for toast, sandwiches, stews and soups. 650g loaf, $4.00

#2: Baguettes: I've been putting this off long enough, so it's time to make some real baguettes. I've been experimenting with several techniques to get a nice crumb structure with our high gluten flours and I'm confident you're really going to like this. 350g Baguette, $2.50

Please note: While they are still good for soup or croutons on Saturday, the baguettes are best enjoyed the same day they are baked!

Best wishes this week!
