Wow. It sure is nice baking in sunshine and warmer temperatures again. It was so bright on Friday I had trouble seeing in the oven with all the shadows across the doorway!

We were really pleased with both loaves last week -- nice oven spring, good colour and flavour that went Pow! We hope you enjoyed the bread as much as we enjoyed making it for you.

This week we are introducing a new loaf and bringing back an old favorite:

#1: Orange Boot Multigrain loaf: We pack this loaf full of grains including brown rice, corn meal, rolled oats and millet for great flavour and good nutrition too.

**- Orange Boot Multigrain, 600g loaf, $3.50** 

#2: Walnut and Raisin Bread: A classic combination of roasted walnuts and raisins give a sweet and nutty taste, along with three different flours for a great bread taste too. Yum!

**- Walnut and Raisin Bread, 600g Boule, $4.00**

Some News: There will be a change to the pickup process this week only. We're getting the drywall finished in the garage this week so **please come to the front of the house** to pick up your bread. It works out well since with all the melting there is a small lake in front of the garage door anyway -- hopefully it will dry up completely in the next two weeks.

One more note: A few folks have been asking for some detailed ingredients for our bread so I've added a bread page to the site. Please drop me a line if you'd like more information and I'll be glad to share it!
