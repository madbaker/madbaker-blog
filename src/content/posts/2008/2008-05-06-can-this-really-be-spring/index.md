Hi Everyone,

Sorry for the delay in getting this note out to you. Spring is in full swing at our place -- a soccer practice tonight, and a game, strawberry jam being made (love the St. Paul's Strawberry Fair!), garden centre gift certificates being processed and my mixer is in pieces. Just a typical Monday this time of year.

The good news is that we're back baking again this Friday. I've still got to service the mixer (found an old diagram on the Net last night so I think I know what I'm doing) but should have that done by Wednesday at the latest. We're going to test the mixer on one of our more challenging loaves, but one I'm really excited about sharing with you. So let's get to it!

#1: Two Castle Rye - this was a big hit at my whole grain class at SFBI both in terms of flavour and appearance. Legend has it that the loaf was first made when two rival kingdoms settled a long war. The loaf is actually two mini-loaves in one, hence the "two castles." From the rye flour in the mix at least one of the castles was German, I'll bet. It's a true multi-grain loaf with white flour, whole wheat and rye flour and a good selection of seeds too. If you like our Birdseed loaf but are looking for a more whole grain flavour then this loaf is for you!

Two Castle Rye - 600g, $4.00

#2: French Loaf - For those of you who like your bread straight up, we offer a French Loaf. It's like our baguette from three weeks ago but larger so you can get some more mileage from bread. Our marketing department is looking for a fancier name than "French Loaf" but there you go.

French Loaf - 500g, $3.00

As is our custom, please order by 6PM on Wednesday by email (mark@madbaker.com) or calling 522-1592. Pick up on Friday between 3PM and 6PM at 2904 Wascana Street.

Best Wishes this week!

=========== What's New at Orange Boot ==============

We've got a new patio in front of the oven thanks to Cindy. No more mud!!! The brick path out to the patio is a work in progress but we're getting there.

The website has had some extensive updates, with more to come. A better 'The Bread' page has detailed ingredients and pictures of all our bread (except this week's bread, but I'm working on it tonight.)
