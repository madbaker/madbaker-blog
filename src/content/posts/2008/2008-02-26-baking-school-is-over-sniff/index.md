*Sigh* Well, the SFBI Whole Grain course is over and I'm back in snowy Regina. It's great to be home but I'm fighting as hard as I can to keep the bread vibe alive. It'll be hard to do that from my cubicle at work but I'm more determined than ever to get our shop opened up sooner rather than later. In fact, I'm meeting with a local SFBI grad tomorrow to keep the process going.

A great big Thank You to Michel, Evelyne, Erin, Laura, Marty, Shari, Jorge and everyone else at SFBI and TMB Baking. You made my three weeks one of the best learning experiences I've ever had. And of course, a very special Thank You to Steve Issac and Didier Rosada, two world class bakers who shared so much knowledge about every facet of the baking process.

PS -- the picture is a display of all the bread we baked during the Whole Grain course. I'm sure you'll agree that there was a huge variety to bake, eat and experience!
