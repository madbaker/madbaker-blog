What an amazing day at the SFBI Whole Grains course. We combined more soakers, preferments and levains than I can count to come up with five complex loaves. The flavours and textures were as varied as the seeds that went in them.

Here's what we made, from the back:

- Prairie Bread 
- Crown of the Great Valley (my favorite in taste and name) 
- Two Castle Rye (#2 in both categories) 
- Finnish Rye (the pun of the day, stated only 14 times was "The Finnish Rye is finished!) 
- Sesame Flame: winner of the shape of the week award.

There are some closeup shots in my [flickr group](http://flickr.com/photos/orangeboot/sets/72157603944031606/). 

I'd love to write more but I'm off to school to make five more loaves today.
