title: "What can I cover best?"

[Jeff Jarvis](http://www.buzzmachine.com/) writes about how newspapers are laying off excellent reporters as they stop coverage of national topics to focus on local news. He offers an [excellent alternative](http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/01/02/halfway-round-the-track/) which preserves the great work the reporters are creating.

Within the post he links to an earlier post which really struck a chord with me. Jeff asserts that a key principle of blogging is to "[Cover what you do best, and link to the rest.](http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/)"

I really like that. It ties in well with the "hyper-local" reporting idea I was kicking around last year -- forget talking about what's happening in Regina and focus in on my neighbourhood, or my street, or my front yard. I set up a [first prototype](http://bigcreek.wordpress.com/) on Wordpress but it's a little stagnant right now.

I can apply Jeff's ideas in 2008 blogging two ways:

- linking to other blogs a lot more

- figuring out what I'm "best at" and covering that

So what am I best at? I've got a few ideas, all involving what's going on in my local community.

What are you best at? Please share!
