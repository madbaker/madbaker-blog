Since the rains have stopped and the weather is warming up Cindy, Patti, Teisha and I sat down and mapped out a new bake schedule for the summer months.  We have expanded the buns, rolls, cookies and muffins to complement the great bread you know and love.

So now whether you're cooking on the panini grill or the BBQ, Orange Boot has the breadstuffs you need for a lovely summer meal.

The new schedule begins July 2.  Please be sure to let us know what you think about it!
