Cindy and Heather have been working all year on a selection of special, extra rich sweets for your sweetheart.  We are offering most of these treats a la carte at the bakery but also in a **special gift box** which you can **order right from this very page!**

Last year our **Box O' Love** was a big favourite with the Bootniks.  We had so many orders that it was hard to find room for all the boxes on the 14th!   So we're bringing it back again this year, but with a few changes:

**1.  The Orange Boot Box O' Love  ($30, pre-order only)** This is a nicely decorated gift box with:

- **one dark chocolate and raspberry muffin**; extra rich and chocolaty
- **one hazelnut chocolate muffin**; a decadent muffin full of ground hazelnuts and chocolate chunks
- **two black forest cookies**; luscious dark and white chocolate cookies with BC dried cherries
- **two linzer cookies;** delightful, crispy heart shaped hazelnut cookies, sandwiched with raspberry jam
- **four heart shaped sugar cookies**
- **two rugelach**; two cool little cream cheese pastries  filled with raspberry jam, chocolate, currants and almonds
- **two friands**; small mouthfuls of chocolate heaven!

**2.  The Box O' Love, Nut Free Edition  ($30, pre-order only)** This is a nicely decorated gift box with:

- two raspberry chocolate muffins
- four black forest cookies
- four heart shaped sugar cookies
- two chocolate friands
- two almond free rugelach

All gift boxes are available via pre-order only.  If you want a gift box to earn the eternal love of your sweetheart, **fill in the form below!**

Now, for those of you who like to leave things to the last minute, or have commitment issues, we can still help!  We are also making:

**3.  The Bag O' Strong Attraction ($14, first come-first serve only)** We'll have a selection of cute gift bags for sale from February 12-14.  Each gift bag contains:

- two linzer cookies
