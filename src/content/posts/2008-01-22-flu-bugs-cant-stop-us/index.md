Hi everyone,

Wow, last week was a bit of a challenge, to say the least. I got hit by a nasty flu bug on Thursday and I'm still working my way back to full fitness, so the vast majority of the firing, baking and packaging fell to Cindy last week. I helped where I could from a respectful distance and wrapped in a blanket, but it all worked out in the end. Sorry I wasn't able to say Hi to everyone who picked up bread but I'm sure you'll agree it was for the best!

You could tell we were a little out of kilter because for the first time in our history, Friday didn't have the nicest weather of the week. I know it wasn't too terrible, but I'm used to seeing sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures when we're baking. Perhaps we'll be treated to a chinook this time round.

This week, we're making two slight modifications to some old favourites:

#1: Orange Boot Birdseed Loaf: This is a "transitional" multigrain loaf -- that is, it still contains white flour but has lots of healthy additions like wheat bran, buttermilk and of course, fresh-roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds. The roasted seeds give the loaf a unique flavour and crunchy chew. Yum!

#2: Our Semolina Loaf is a simple loaf with a deceptively complex flavour thanks to an extremely slow rise. We start building the dough Wednesday for a Friday bake and the dough does most of its rising in the cooler. The bread contains a mix of white flour and durum semolina flour from locally grown, organic grain and when shaped in the traditional 'S' and topped with sesame seeds becomes _Pane Siciliano_, which makes it more fun too!

As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.

Robyn promises to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don’t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.

Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn
