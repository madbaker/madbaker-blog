I found this [neat survey](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) over at the [Doc Searls weblog](http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/12/28#showingTendencies) last week. It attempts to plot one on a 2x2 matrix based on the more traditional 'left - right' political continuum but also on a social axis.

I ended up "Left Libertarian" and quite a ways on the edge at that. Not exactly in vogue these days, but I knew that already.

How about you?
