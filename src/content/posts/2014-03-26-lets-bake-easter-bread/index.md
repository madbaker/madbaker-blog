***Note:  This round of classes is sold out.  Stay tuned for more classes next month!**

It’s time for more baking classes!  In April, we’re going to run two classes where you can learn to make Easter Bread just like we make at Orange Boot Bakery.  This hands on course will cover mixing our Raisin Cranberry Easter Bread dough, fermentation, and braiding both as a long loaf and our traditional round loaf.

By the end of the class, each attendee will have three loaves to take home for Easter – enough for you and a gift too if you like.

Our Easter Bread is my take on the _Kolach_ my grandmother made every year at Easter.   Armed with my recipe (home scaled of course) and the techniques we’ll teach at the class, you will be able to add to your own holiday baking tradition, or start a new tradition for years to come.

Class 2: Sunday April 13, 2014

Class Time: Noon – 4:30PM, or until the bread is baked and cool enough to bag.
