Eddy Mysliwiec was one of the organizers of the [A Taste For Grain](http://atasteforgrain.ca/) gathering that I attended this summer, and ever since we met I’ve been wondering about his story. When we finally sat down to chat a few weeks back, I learned that we have more in common than a love for baking.

It turns out that Eddy cooked in order to pay for school, but after a few years at a ‘real job’, realized the draw of feeding people was too strong. His micro-bakery, Breddy Boulangerie is making locals very happy indeed, but will he be able to keep things ‘micro’ and still make a living? We talk about all this and more. Enjoy!
