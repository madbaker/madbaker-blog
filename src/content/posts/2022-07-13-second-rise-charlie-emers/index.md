Charlie Emers and I only connected via the Guild email list until we got together for a conversation back in early 2021. ([Rise Up! #118](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-118-charlie-emers))

Since he was on the show, we've struck up a fun correspondence, with Charlie writing me long emails from his front porch.  I imagine him hitting send and then either heading to the bake shop or sneaking out the back of the farm for a hike or a ski.  It's a friendship I cherish.
