[Prairie Dog magazine is my "go to" resource](http://www.prairiedogmag.com/) for finding out what's new and interesting in the Regina food scene.  This month they are once again running their ["Best in Food" reader poll](http://prairedogmag.upickem.net/engine/Welcome.aspx?contestid=88870) to determine the best pubs, eateries, diners and, yes, bakeries.

We've been honoured to be named ["Regina's Best Bakery"](http://www.prairiedogmag.com/best-of-food-2012/#shopping) the past two years and it would be huge for us to win again this year.

Why?  Because it's a Reader Poll.  That means when Orange Boot wins Best Of something in the Prairie Dog, it's a legitimate endorsement, not a paid for 'advertorial'.

It means you, our True Fans, think we're doing OK. That you're rooting for us.  That you want us to succeed.

That means a lot to me.

It's also important that Bootniks vote in lots of categories, because it helps both of us.  You get a chance to win **$500 in gift certificates** from the Prairie Dog, and I get to learn what you think is the best burger, and the best coffee shop, and the best brew pub. I mean, I'm not at the bakery all the time -- I need to know where to go to eat!

So please [vote quick.](http://prairedogmag.upickem.net/engine/Welcome.aspx?contestid=88870)  Don't wait.  Don't forget.  And I hope you win the prize, too.
