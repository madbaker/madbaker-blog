Stephen Knight has led a full and rich life and in many ways, he’s just getting started. After a full and successful career as a broadcaster and journalist, Steve switched to baking and has worked in some of the most renowned bakeries in New York and Seattle. Currently Stephen is the head baker at the Expedia Group kitchen in Seattle, or he will be again once Covid passes.

We had a great conversation. You can tell Steve is a former journalist when, right at the start, he turns the tables and starts asking me questions, calmly and firmly telling his story, and so on. I loved it and learned as much about interviewing as I did about baking!

And we also talked about how he caught a serious heart aneurysm that required immediate emergency surgery before cutting his life short and how he recovered and keeps working in production bakeries to this day. That hit home with me because it’s the same condition that took my grandfather and great-uncle far too early. I’m glad Steve caught it in time.

Once again, this chat was a huge reminder of our rich and full community of bakers and how we all have interesting stories to tell. It’s a privilege to share Steve’s story with you.
