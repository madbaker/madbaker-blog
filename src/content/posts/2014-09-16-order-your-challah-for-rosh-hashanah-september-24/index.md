Friend of Orange Boot Gail Greenberg emailed last week to remind me that Rosh Hashanah begins on Wednesday September 24th and to ask whether we’d be making round Challah this year.  Absolutely!

We will be making both plain Challah and Challah with Raisins next Wednesday and they’ll be ready for pickup when we open at 9:30AM.

While we will have a few Challah in the display case, we will be primarily baking them to fill pre-orders, so **please order in advance** so you don’t miss out!

You can order by calling the bakery at (306) 584-2668 or using our [online order form.](#)  If you’re ordering online please don’t forget to specify whether you want raisins or not.
