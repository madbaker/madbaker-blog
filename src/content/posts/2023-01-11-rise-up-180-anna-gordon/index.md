Anna Gordon started selling her amazing cookies at the Brooklyn Flea in 2010 and has since created a delicious destination bakery in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.  

In this episode, we kick off 2023 with a vibrant conversation about Anna's love of creating layers of flavours and textures, visualizing the perfect day of a bakery owner, and what it's like to create a platform that does so much tasty good in her community.

It’s a fun conversation, with plenty of inspiration for bakers and bakery owners, no matter where you live. Listen below or over at [riseuppod.com](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-180-anna-gordon)
