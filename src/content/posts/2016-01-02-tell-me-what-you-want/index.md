We just got back from a Christmas holiday to Calgary and Fernie, and not a moment too soon.   Another day or two and I'd end up causing a big fight.

The trip was great, but highlighted by a series of strange communication errors. Either I would only hear half of what someone was saying, or I'd only say half of what I meant.  So many situations were unnecessarily strained, from arranging a meeting with my aunt and uncle or sorting the recycling as we cleaned out the condo in Fernie.

Inevitably I'd get frustrated by the misunderstanding.  Of course we were going to meet today!  Clearly this pile is recycling and that is garbage!  Then I'd get accused of being 'snippy' which would raise the tension three more levels.

Luckily we had a nine hour drive home where I could stew, mope, then try to figure things out.  I was taken back to a "[Crucial Conversations](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Crucial-Conversations-Audiobook/B002V5CZ5A)" class I took years ago where the instructor kept quoting the Spice Girls.

_Tell me what you want.  What you really, really want!_

If what I really, really want is smoother, easier, stress free conversations with my friends and family (and I do), then that's what I need to focus on.

Relax.  Get centred.  Explain in detail what I'm thinking.  Ask for feedback.  Ask for input.  Ensure we have understanding.  Then ensure we agree on the next step.

It's hard for me, because I'm either experiencing life in big gulps and don't want to stop, or I'm anxious about something and am dancing around the issue.

But if I'm going to reduce the number of Defcon 4 moments, I better stick to the program.

_Relax.  Get centred.  Explain in detail what I'm thinking.  Ask for feedback.  Ask for input.  Ensure we have understanding.  Then ensure we agree on the next step._

I'm not really one for New Year's Resolutions, but it seems I have one this year.
