I just completed the final stitch in a weeks long crochet project and I'm very happy.  It's a gift blanket for a friend and I've been working on it for well over a month.

The blanket is in three colours, made by tapestry crochet, where you bring all three colours along for the ride across the entire blanket.  The design is the [Aita Blanket by Molla Mills](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/aita), with some changes to the border, and with custom colours selected by Cindy and me.  I saw the pattern in her book [Crochet Crush](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/crochet-crush/patterns) and fell in love with it.  Thank goodness the book was in our local library!  

This is my first tapestry crochet project.  Only my second project overall, to be fair.  I did a small sampler with scrap yarn and then went whole hog on a full sized blanket.

Blocks of baby blue, dark blue and golden yellow sections made to look like thick woven bands","the blanket in all its glory" %}

Some stats:

- We settled on the pattern and colours in mid-May of this year, and I bought the yarn on May 27th.
- In all I used two skeins of each blue shade and three skeins of the yellow (I have plenty of leftovers in each colour for smaller projects now)
- I didn't track hours, but I worked on it nearly every day for six weeks.
- I had a due date of the end of July, so I'm happily finished several weeks early.

Now all I need to do is wash / block the blanket and find a nice way to wrap it up to give it away.
