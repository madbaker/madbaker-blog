After a slight blip mid-week, summer is back in full force.  Highs of 28C on the weekend means the downtown has cleared out and everyone is making their way to the beach by any means necessary.  We were out for a drive today and stopped at the Colwood lagoon, where the breeze off the ocean dropped the temperatures at least 10 degrees.  It's both extremely refreshing and a recipe for sunburn if you're not careful.

### The Week's Business

This week was dominated with securing a substitute housesitter for the midpoint of our August trip to Saskatchewan.  Our sitters asked to fly to Ontario for a week in the middle of their stay to attend a family reunion and we obliged.  Having a cat makes travel complicated --  we really should have got Iggy used to travelling when she was younger, so she could just come with us.  But she's 12 now and very set in her ways, so housesitters are the way we do it. 

The second bit of business was getting a tooth pulled and implant installed on Thursday.  It's a traumatic bit of business and not just because of the price.  I'm hepped up on Tylenol, antibiotics, and mouth stitches for the next week.  Ugh.

On Wednesday, Cindy and I both sat down with Nate Houge to talk about the Orange Boot Days.  The conversation is supposed to be for a bonus episode of [Rise Up](http://riseuppod.com) but I will need to get some gumption and edit it down a lot first.

### This Week's Fun

We went on an excellent bike ride on Monday morning, along the Lochside Trail to [Mattick's Farm](https://www.matticksfarm.com/) and back again.  It was the perfect morning for a ride and I was feeling strong, so made it over the Gorge trestle and the Carey Road overpass without incident.  Great fun.

I made it out for two sessions of Lawn Bowling too, on Tuesday and Friday afternoons.  Bowled pretty darn well in both sessions too, although Tuesday's game still took me 6-7 ends to loosen up and find my line and weight.  The other folks don't warm up before games but I really need a good 20 minutes of stretching and practice bowling before the game.  Otherwise we're always coming from behind.

And of course, we had some excellent walks throughout the week as well.  James Bay, Ross Bay, Gonzales Bay and Beacon Hill Park all received thorough inspections and some relaxing pauses too.  It seems like all I need for summer is a log to sit on and a good book.  

### Garden Update

The flipside of a long growing season is that by July, my balcony garden is looking quite tired.  The lettuce is done and we've just about eaten all the peas.  So I have more bare beds and beds that need clearing than back in March.  And all the while, the wind blows and blows.  But that's the way it goes.

I have started pulling up the garlic and it looks like I'll get some actual bulbs this year.  The lettuce bed has been re-seeded and a few radishes have already poked their heads above ground.  The sweet peas are excellent and half the cosmos are the best ever.  And the tomatoes are loving this brief but intense heatwave.  I shouldn't complain, really.

###  What filled me up this week

- We saw [The Hobby: Tales from the Tabletop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31189867/) at the Vic Theatre.  It was OK, but I really wanted more from this documentary.  It was a celebration of board game culture, but they left it firmly in the world of odd balls and 'sub-culture' when I think board games are much more mainstream than all that.  Still, I'd give it a 7/10 or so.

- I'm reading a collection of David Graeber essays called [The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205363978-the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world). I'm a big fan of Graeber's writing and his ideas.  Many of the essays selected for this book seem to be pre-cursors to later books, notably [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) and [The Utopia of Rules](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22245334-the-utopia-of-rules).  Recommended reading, for sure, since it's well written without being too academic. And my goodness, his ideas and observations sure put a lot of our current mess into context.

- My song of the week is from this morning's Discovery Playlist:  [_Camouflage_, by Stan Ridgway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFYxCIr-Byo).  This song caught me off guard.  Stan's voice is unique and the song took me right back his singing on one of my all time favourite albums, Wall of Voodoo's _Call of the West._  I played _Call of the West_ so much I nearly wore out the record, then left it on the dash of my car once and it warped, but I still played it even though the needle would fly off the vinyl.
