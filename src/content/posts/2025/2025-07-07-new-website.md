Now that my year long [Nature Diary](https://madbaker.com/tags/diary) project is complete, it's time to get back to plain old blogging.  (The two things are not mutually exclusive, of course, but I inadvertently made it that way.)

But in thinking about blogging again, I remembered some of the frustrations I have with this website, and am compelled to fix them.  And by fix a few problems I mean, start over from scratch.

This site is built using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).  I love Eleventy.  But over the past year Zach has released a whole new version along with new, improved plugins, so I want to bring the site up to date.  

I built this site by reading several excellent tutorials, using a startup template and adding far too many hunks of code from other amazing Eleventy sites.  The net result however is that I don't really understand the code behind my own site, so that needs to change as well.

Version 1 of the site met my main criteria at the time:

- get all my old blogs into one place
- have a way to easily publish new posts
- be a lean, mean, fast, lightweight personal website
- have a generally appealing look to it

This next version is going to build on those strengths, but in a way that I am more in-tune with the code, so I am not afraid to make tweaks and enhancements.

So here are my new goals:

## The Project

- **Build the site in Eleventy 3.1+ completely from scratch.**  Don't add anything that I do not understand.  
- Don't even use the Eleventy-base-blog starter template (although I'm still wavering about this one!)
- Document the process as I go and cite all my sources.  (I notice that all the tutorials and walkthroughs on the internet are several years old, using Eleventy 2.0 or earlier.  I want to bring this up to date.)

## The Use Cases

- The concept is shifting even more towards a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).  Half baked thoughts and ideas are OK.
- bring even more of my whole self to the blog.  Document my new passions, from crochet to gardening to stamps and lawn bowls as well.
- maybe add photo galleries?
- definitely add week notes!
- Soundtracks?  Book Lists?  Why not?


## Writing Workflow

- refactor the code and file structures so I better understand the flow from markdown files to a final html page. Not necessarily adopting Nunchuk macros for code snippets but understand how I could do this when it makes sense.
  
## Eleventy

- Optimized images using the updated Eleventy-img plugin
- more structured documents and more rigourous use of front matter like how [Miriam](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/) does it.
- create pages for major project tags (again, sort of like how Miriam does it.)
- implement search without using Netlify functions

## CSS

- understand it!  Implement a clean design without copying whole hog from someone else.


This is an incomplete, poorly structured list at this point.  But it's a start!
