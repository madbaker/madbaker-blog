title: "Oven in the Snow"

It's snowing for about the fifth day in a row now and as I look out the dining room window at the brick oven I can help but wonder what effect all that snow has on the brickwork. I didn't get a chimney cap installed (or designed) in time so there's about 4 inches of snow on top of the chimney and inside too. My wood pile is buried too so the wood certainly isn't seasoning the way I'd like. I think the best approach is to split it as small as I can manage and store it under the oven till spring. At least it'll stay dry that way.
