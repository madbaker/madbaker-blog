When the big Covid lockdown started in March, 2020, the folks at [Slung Low](https://www.slunglow.org/) theatre company didn't know what to do.

They couldn't put on shows, that's for sure. And they couldn't open the pub they operated either.

But they knew why they existed: to serve the people of Holbeck, Leeds. To be a foundational part of their community.

So they started writing letters.

They wrote to the 200 households around the theatre and said, we are here. We're still healthy. We have a car and a van. What do you need?

And they started making deliveries, bringing food and medicine to shut ins.

Love, connection and support finds a way.

What if it only took a letter? What would you write?
