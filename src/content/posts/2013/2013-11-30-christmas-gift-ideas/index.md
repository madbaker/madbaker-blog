We have been getting lots of calls about this and thought you might be interested too. If you are looking for a fun, tasty gift idea this year, we have two options that might help.

#1 We offer **Orange Boot Bakery gift certificates** ranging from a baguette stocking stuffer to $50 and more, as you need. Some Bootniks have already asked for a bunch of $10 certificates for work mates, and a mom from Alberta called for a big one for her son in Regina.

Gift Certificates are available any time you come in, or call ahead (306-584-2668) and we'll have them ready for you when you arrive.

#2  We can also make you a **custom Gift Basket** if you'd like to see the excitement first hand and possibly share in the spoils. Gift Baskets start at $40 and can be built to suit, with bread, sweets or both. We'll need some advance notice to make these up for you -- two days is best, or one day if you're in a real bind.

To order your Gift Basket, give us a call at **306-584-BOOT**!  (584-2668)
