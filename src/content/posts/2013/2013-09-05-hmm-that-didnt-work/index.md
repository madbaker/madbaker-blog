When I got the notification emails that Posterous was shutting down and I should back up all my posts, I didn't worry about it. Ignored them all.

"No worries!" said I. "I already pushed every post to my Wordpress blog at time of posting. I'll be fine."

It turns out that the words pushed over, but all my pictures linked back to the copy at Posterous. Seeing how I was doing more and more short posts with lots of pictures, that means most of the posts I made from 2009-2011 now have big blank spaces where the pictures should be.

Rats.

I guess that means I need to get off my butt and start posting more. OK! I'm up for the challenge.
