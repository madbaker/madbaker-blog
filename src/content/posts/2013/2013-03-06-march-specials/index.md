March is an especially crazy month at the bakery, especially with Easter coming early. We've got a lot of special baking planned for you.

#### St. Patrick's Day Specials

Cindy O'Dyck, Heather O'Dorr and Teisha McHuff have been hard at it for a week now getting a hint o'the Irish into the bakery. Irish Soda Bread is our Bread of the Month for the first half of March, available now and every day until March 16. Our soda bread is a result of a ton of tests based on recipes from our friend (and real Irish Lady) Rosanne Copithorn. The Orange Boot Bakery version is a light but hearty loaf with some whole wheat, oats and raisins. More bread than muffin, the smell of them makes me want to brew some tea whenever a batch comes out of the oven.

We will also have extra lucky Shamrock and Checkerboard Sugar Cookies and Chocolate Mint Whoopie Pies beginning next Tuesday, March 12.

Both the Irish Soda Bread and Shamrock cookies were a huge hit last year, so please call ahead so you don't miss out. I'm still getting used to this 10 digit dialing, so please don't forget the '306' -- (306) 584-2668.

#### Easter Specials

If [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OrangeBootBakery) is any indication, there have been a lot of people patiently waiting for our Orange Boot Hot Cross Buns. Heck, someone even asked about them in January!

I'm happy to announce that **Hot Cross Buns will be back starting at 9:30AM on Tuesday, March 12** and will be available every day until Easter.

Our Hot Cross Buns are the real deal -- light, sweet, fruity spiced buns with the traditional flour paste cross, lightly brushed with a sweet glaze after baking. Without a doubt, they are our single most popular baked item and I'm sure there will be lineups once again this year.

We're still making them fresh, by hand, every morning, so quantities are truly limited. Don't miss out! Order today at (306) 584-2668.

We will also be making **our special Easter Bread** from Tuesday, March 19 till Easter Saturday, March 30. Some call it Pascka, some Kolach -- it's our take on the Easter Bread my Grandma made when I was a boy. Rich, sweet and round, with a fancy braided top.

We will have **two types of Easter Bread** available. One with raisins and cranberries and one without. A loaf or two will make a great addition to your Easter table. Please order yours soon to avoid disappointment.

Finally, like any other Special Eating Time, **we'll be making extra dinner buns**. Primarily our soft white pull apart buns, but extra country style and 100% whole wheat too. It's really worthwhile to order these in advance too since we never know how many to make.

**Update:** Orders are now closed for March. Â There will be lots available Thursday and Easter Saturday, first come first served at the bakery, starting at 9:30AM each day.
