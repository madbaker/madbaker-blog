Here's a quick heads up about two of our specialty loaves that are headed to a semi-permanent retirement.

Our **Wild Rice Multigrain Loaf**, currently available on Saturdays, will be made for the final time this Saturday, November 30.

Our Tuesday specialty bun &  loaf, **Semolina with Fennel and Raisins** will also be going on hiatus.  Their last day is next Tuesday, December 3.

If this announcement has you shocked, outraged and generally disappointed, don't fear. We can still make this for you as a special order item, or can recommend a similar loaf. Give us a call at the bakery and we'll work something out.
