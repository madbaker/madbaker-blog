I just heard about [two](http://gabriolabakery.blogspot.com/2007/05/today-we-are-masons.html) [fellows](http://web.mac.com/macewen/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html) on Gabriola Island BC who are building a commercial oven and hope to open a bakery this year. They started baking out of their homes two years ago, which is a pattern I want to emulate in Saskatchewan.

I hope to go see them as I'll be out that way next month. I might even need to pack a trowel or two!
