My post rate has been abysmal. I'm still adding to my list of things to blog about without actually blogging, which kind of defeats the purpose. Thanks to my readers (both of you) for sticking with me during the lean time.

In the meantime I've been reading a tonne! 6 book plus several thousand blog posts in the last month. I'm using Google Reader to aggregate everything and they have an excellent 'share' feature. Check out the "I'm Reading" section in the sidebar for the recent posts I've read that are worth sharing.

They're also worth commenting on, which is something I need to do more of. Starting tonight!
