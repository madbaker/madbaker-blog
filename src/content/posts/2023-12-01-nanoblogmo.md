It's the first of December, which means that there are several hundred new novels born today.  Or at least first drafts of novels.  That's because National Novel Writing Month, or [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/national-novel-writing-month) is over for another year.

I have a couple of friends who completed NaNoWriMo in the past and it's a worthy accomplishment.  It's the first marathon for creative folk. One that I've dreamed of but never even started.  

I'm attracted to the idea of a streak, but I don't have a novel idea yet. So I started a personal blogging journey.  One post per day for the entire month of November.  And I did it too.

I call this momentous achievement NaNoBlogMo.  And you can do it too.  You don't even have to wait for November.  You can do it any month you like.  Heck, the acronym doesn't line up anymore, so make it fit as you need.  Do it from the 3rd to the 3rd if you need to.

Let me tell you though - it feels very, very good to set a goal and make it.  Go for it, please.  I want to read your posts.

PS - I also kept up a streak for writing a morning journal / diary / morning pages all month long too.  I call that one NaNoJourNo.  Two pages, hand written or typed.  It felt better than the blogging, if I'm honest.  Feel free to do that one too.  âœ¨
