We took a couple days off from the tent and headed for Courtney and Comox. Good thing too because it rained harder then ever on Saturday. But we were hanging out at the pool at the Best Western.

The first impression of Courtney isn't pretty. Block after block of big boxes - the same concrete and stores as any other North American city of over 50,000 people. Why oh why do people want this? Why oh why do they want to do this to SW Regina now too??

The good news, however, is that they citizens of Courtney have been able to preserve their downtown. It's only six blocks, but it's lovely. Narrow streets, interesting shops, bakeries, restaurants, sporting goods, library, museum and art gallery. Sweet! We spend several hours (and more than a few dollars) in downtown Courtney and loved every minute.

Today we're off to Powell River on the mainland - just about ready to board the ferry - see you on the other side!
