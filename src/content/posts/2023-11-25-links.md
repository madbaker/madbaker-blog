Something changes in my reading habits when I know I'll be sharing my favourites with you on Saturday.  Here's the best from my week's reading - enjoy!

- **[The Creative Brief from the Brand Agency That Launched Thanksgiving](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-creative-brief-from-the-brand-agency-that-launched-thanksgiving)** I snort-laughed several times while reading this.  That's a good thing. (via McSweeney's)

- **[Pluralistic: Thankful for class consciousness](https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/24/coalescence/)**  Very interesting post by Cory Doctorow about how "antitrust" is something people can rally around like "ecology" and how it's already helping bring prices down in the US.  I was thankful he also talked about how Canada's competition laws are almost non-existent, which contributes to things like the grocery greedflation we've seen this year.

- **[Manifesto for posting online in 2023](https://meandorla.substack.com/p/manifesto-for-posting-online-in-2023)** I'm sticking to posting on my own blog these days.  But if I were to go back to posting on social media, this would be useful advice.  (via roytang.net)

- **[Websites that spark joy](https://whimsical.club/)** This is a website, not an article.  A wonderful, curated list of websites that have an extra bit of delight in them.  Worth a surf when you're feeling blue and aren't willing to tackle the manifesto I just shared.  (via thejollyteapot.com)

- One more Thanksgiving post from McSweeney's then I'll stop, I swear:  **[Post-Dinner Interview with a Twelve-Year-Old Who Sat at the Grown-Upsâ€™ Table for the First Time on Thanksgiving](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/post-dinner-interview-with-a-twelve-year-old-who-sat-at-the-grown-ups-table-for-the-first-time-on-thanksgiving)**
