Jessica Rivers is co-owner and connection engine of the amazing bakery [Working Culture Bread](https://www.workingculturebread.com/) in Victoria BC.  In the three years since I talked to her husband Adam in [Episode #128](https://riseuppod.com/rise-up-128-adam-christie), the bakery has grown and their family has too.  Through it all, Jess and the Working Culture team have built even stronger ties within the community, through fundraising, advocacy and lots of listening to the people in her neighbourhood.

In this episode, Jess and I talk about how starting a family helped her baking team grow closer, her faith in food providers to come together to help people in town and around the world, and her new project, Club Bop, which helps local small businesses of all stripes support each other.
