It's Ukranian Christmas today, or more accurately, Christmas Day according to the Julian Calendar.   I figured it was a good time to share the latest email that went out to our Bootnik email list on December 29. The Bootnik list is the best way so far to get the latest Orange Boot Bakery news delivered straight to your email inbox.  If you haven't yet, why not subscribe today [link]?

**Happy Holidays!**

We hope you're all having a great holiday week.  We were going hard at the bakery right up till Christmas Eve then took a couple days off to be with our family and recharge a little.  Then it's been back to the bakery to paint, assemble equipment and clean.  We're always cleaning.  I'm sure our shop will be cleaner than the first day the mall opened, but it's worth it.

**Opening Day is Getting Close**

We're not 100% sure when opening day is, but it's not too far off.  If all goes well we'll be ready to start bringing flour and other ingredients into the shop in a week or so.  Opening in mid-January is our best guess at this point.

We'll be letting people know via the Bootnik email list: if you haven't yet,  please sign up [link] and you won't miss a thing!

**In the Meantime**

It's not good bread, but at least here's a hint of how your bread will be baked.  Last week we took delivery of our MIWE Condo bread oven.  Built in Germany, used for a week at the IBIE baking conference in Las Vegas, then delivered to Regina via New Jersey and Toronto.  The last 50 feet were the toughest as Cindy, her dad Chris and a great forklift operator threaded the needle to get this large oven through a surprisingly small door opening.   Cindy was calm enough to film parts of it -- it's not White Christmas but it's not bad either.  Can you feel the tension?

**Happy New Year!** 2010 has been a crazy adventure for us as we finally took the plunge to open Regina's first artisan bread bakery.  2011 will no doubt be even wilder when we start baking for you and get serious about bringing you the best bread we possibly can.  Your emails and phone calls keep us going; thank you so much for your support over the past two months.

We wish you huge success and happiness in 2011.  If we can add a wee bit of great taste and nutrition to your best year ever, then we'll be very happy indeed.
