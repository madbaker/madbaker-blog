Hello Happy People!

This is the snow we came back to, after a week in frigid, snowy Saskatchewan. I guess we were feeling too superior with our ‘ooh, it’s always +8!” and “you can’t shovel rain!” attitudes.

Well, I’m not shovelling this snow either. I’m waiting for the rain tomorrow to wash it all away. And today, after I hit ‘publish’, I think I’ll start chucking snowballs off my balcony. Oh, yeah!

This week’s podcast is a solo affair, but it’s inspired by a conversation I’ve had a hundred times or more: Tracking.

It seems like bakers can’t make more than 3 or 4 products before we start thinking “I gotta get on top of things.” Then out pops Excel, or if you’re frugal, Sheets, or if you’re cool, Numbers and we start building spreadsheets. Lots and lots and lots of spreadsheets.

_Then_ it seems like once we get 4-5 spreadsheets, we start thinking “There must be a way to link these all together!” And we are sucked into the Spreadsheet Abyss, never to touch a dough ball again.

When it comes to tracking, there is lots we _can_ do, and some that we _must_ do. How can we tell the difference and make tracking our b*tch, instead of the other way round?

I’m not sure I have the answer, but I have a point of view, and possibly a way out. Let me know what you think!

PS - it’s also Mail Time! Lots going on in the baking world these days!
