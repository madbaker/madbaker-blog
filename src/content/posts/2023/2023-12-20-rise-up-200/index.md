The podcast hits a major milestone by going back to the beginning. 

In this special 200th episode, Mark is joined by Daisy Chow of [Breadboard Bakery](https://breadboardbakery.square.site/) in Arlington, Massachusetts. and Nate Houge of [Brake Bread](https://www.brakebread.com/) in St. Paul, Minnesota for a wide ranging conversation about everything that's changed since they first met back at Wheatstalk in Rhode Island in 2018, when the podcast was an idea but not yet a real thing.

Recorded on the Monday before US Thanksgiving, with Nate preparing for a night of baking and Daisy rolling out pie dough on camera, the three friends talk about staffing, about product lineups, and about making the difficult changes to make their bakeries sustainable for the long term.
