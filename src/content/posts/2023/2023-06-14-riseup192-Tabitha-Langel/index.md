This week we go back to the prairies with an amazing conversation with Tabitha Langel and Ryan Stoesz of Tall Grass Prairie Bakery in Winnipeg.  

Tabitha has been a guiding light in the Wolseley neighbourhood in Winnipeg for over 40 years and her thoughtfulness, intention and faith comes through so clearly as we discuss the early days of the bakery and its slow, intentional growth over the years. We dig into the care they bring to employee relationships and conflict resolution.  We also talk about succession planning at the bakery, as Tabitha begins to step back and Ryan steps forward.

And yes, I go a little overboard about prairie farmers markets, Hudderite cucumbers and canning pickles.  No apologies for that -- it's in my DNA.
