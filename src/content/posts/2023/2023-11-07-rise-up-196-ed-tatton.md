The podcast is back after a bit of hiatus, with a great talk with Ed and Natasha Tatton.  Their new book, [BReD: Sourdough loaves, small breads and other plant-based baking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976467-bred) is out today in bookstores across the land, and it's a triumph for fine plant-based baking.

Ed's been on the show before, back in 2021 ([Episode 128](https://riseuppod.com/rise-up-126-edward-tatton)) but a lot has changed for Ed and the bakery in that time.  Rebuilding a baking crew after Covid, dealing with soaring costs, getting certified as a B-Corp, and of course, writing this amazing cookbook.  

We talk about all of it and pay special attention to two areas:  their commitment to plant based baking and cooking and bringing a huge range of flavours to their baking.  Natasha's leadership in vegan living and cooking paired with Ed's flair for flavour combinations make for a stellar partnership, whether on the page or at [their bakery in Whistler BC](https://edsbred.com/).

It's a fun and far ranging conversation, and is a fitting kickoff to the new season of Rise Up.
