This table will at least help us to respond to the short
questionnaire that every philatelist must formulate in relation
to each example in his collection:
- What stamp is this?
- Why was it made?
- What event or fact did it arise from?
- What makes it different from other stamps?
- What is the meaning of its graphic structure?
- What was the motivation behind its postal origin?
In a second phase of ideas, we must consider points of a
methodological nature:
- Where can I include it?
- What place should it occupy in the general context of
my collection?
- What commentaries or caption will it be possible to
give it?
If we cannot give a correct response to each of these items,
all we will have is a square of little value.
