We're heading back home in this episode of Rise Up!  Sort of.  I get a chance to talk to my friend Claudia Fimbres, an amazing cook and wonderful human who I worked with in Regina.  We only worked together for a few months but became friends immediately and have stayed in touch, even though we now live as far apart as possible while still remaining in Canada.

Claudia was born and raised in Mexico and is bringing the flavours of home to the people of St. John's, Newfoundland.  It's not easy work but it's vital.  I didn't know Newfoundland was home to as many Latin immigrants as there are, and they crave the flavours of home.  The native Islanders deserve excellent food too.  Claudia and Brad are feeding them all.

They named [Mamacita](https://mamacitakitchen.ca/) after Claudia's mom, but after you listen to this conversation, I think you'll see that Claudia is 'Mamacita' to many, many grateful souls out on 'The Rock'.
