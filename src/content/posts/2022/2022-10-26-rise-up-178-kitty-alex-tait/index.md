A few weeks ago, Cindy forced me to sit down and read a new bread book, [Breadsong: How Baking Change Our Lives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58532189-breadsong) . It’s the best book I’ve read this year, period and I’m thrilled to be talking to the authors, the daughter and dad duo of Kitty and Alex Tait on this week’s podcast.

As a 14 year old, Kitty Tait was struggling with her mental health and her parents tried to help her find something to lighten the burden. Arts and crafts didn’t do the trick, but helping her dad Alex bake bread sure did.

Kitty was hooked, and started on an incredible journey of baking more and more bread, learning the intricacies of the craft as she went from the baker community on Instagram. Soon she was baking for her neighbours, then her entire village.

Before too long, both Kitty and Alex were baking full time. The Orange Bakery was born and it grew and grew, from their home kitchen to their back garden, to a shop on High Street and a converted Boy Scout lodge for their production.

Our conversation, held on one of their rare evenings off, digs into the generosity of the baking community, the deep roots they have in their village, and how Kitty’s already looking at new ways to feed more and more people.

It’s also a great opportunity to see how these two family members and business partners complement each other. Their dynamic comes across well in the book but it shines in audio. Listen below or over at [riseuppod.com](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-178-kitty-and-alex-tait)
