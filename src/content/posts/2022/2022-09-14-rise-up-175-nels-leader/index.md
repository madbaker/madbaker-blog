Bread Alone Bakery is one of the iconic American artisan bakeries. Dan Leader and Sharon Burns-Leader started the bakery in the 1980’s and they are still going strong, serving up organic, artisanal sourdough loaves in grocery stores around New York and in their four cafes.

Since taking over as CEO from his parents several years ago, Nels Leader has focused on the climate and their employees. They recently transformed their Boiceville, NY bakery to being fully carbon neutral and are now embarking on transforming the relationship between their employees and the business.

As Nels sees it, the challenges never stop at the bakery, they just shift. We had an excellent talk and I’m sure you’ll take a lot of inspiration from this conversation, no matter where you are in your bakery journey.
