It's harvest time! This week on Rise Up! I talk with Elizabeth DeRuff from [Honore Farm and Mill](https://honoremill.org) in Marin County, California.

Elizabeth and her team are on a remarkable journey, helping city folk get reconnected to the land and learn where and how their flour and bread is made. And they are also reaching deep into the past to explore how wheat can be delicious and healthy for more people.

In this episode, we talk about what drew Elizabeth into farming, milling and baking, the goals for the farm and the fascinating story of Hourani wheat, a heritage variety they are growing that dates back 2000 years.
