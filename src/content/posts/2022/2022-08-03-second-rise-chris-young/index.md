Cindy and I are travelling in England and Scotland this summer.  I expect to be heading to a lot of bakeries on this trip, eating the good stuff and learning more about the #realbread scene there. 

#realbread is a proper movement in the UK and Chris Young is the guy who keeps the energy high and the momentum growing.  So it's only fitting that we bring back the conversation we had last year ([Rise Up! #146](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-146-chris-young)), prior to another month of celebrations of all things Sourdough.  They run a month-long #sourdoughseptember campaign and finally, for the first time ever, I'm out in front of it in 2022.  Yippee!

Chris is a cool guy and the campaign is interesting and important.  So get ready to dig into a 100% naturally leavened conversation with Chris Young of the real bread campaign.
