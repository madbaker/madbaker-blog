Randy George was one of my mentors when we had Orange Boot Bakery, although we never spoke 1:1 until this talk in September 2018.  ([Rise Up! #24](http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-24-randy-george))

When I was planning the podcast, Randy was one of the people at the top of my list of folks to talk to, because he was really focused on putting his employees front and centre in the bakery.  He was the guy you turned to when attracting and retaining employees came up.  And his bakery is a wholesale operation, which I knew nothing about but was curious to learn about.  So I was thrilled when we finally got to spend some time together.

There's lots in this talk that you're going to love.
