We know that fall has fully arrived in Regina with the cool rain this weekend, but it was still a bit of a surprise to see that Thanksgiving is this weekend.  Lots to do, lots to do!

October brings us our traditional holiday loaf, the **Pear Buckwheat Loaf,** available every day in October.  Or until we run out of pears.

This is a fun loaf that celebrates the late summer harvest with pears three ways.  Dried pears are soaked in white wine before being added to this wheat and buckwheat flour loaf.  Then the loaf is shaped like a pear.  Then we put a pear stencil on top.  Fun, fun!

Even though we're making this loaf every day in October, we expect them to sell out every day.  For sure on Thanksgiving Weekend.  So please order your loaf now to avoid disappointment.  (Or anything else you'd like!)
