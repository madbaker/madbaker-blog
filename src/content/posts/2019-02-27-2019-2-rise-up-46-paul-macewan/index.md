He had no idea until we spoke, but Paul MacEwan was a huge inspiration to me as a baker and bakery builder. That’s because I stumbled across their bakery building blog way back in 2007 and read and re-read every single post.

The blog covered the step by step process of building an absolutely gorgeous timber bake house in the woods of Gabriola Island, BC and then building a massive brick oven in the middle of the bake house.

Holy! If they could build all that and start baking for farmer’s markets, the least I could do is build a brick oven and start selling bread to friends, right?

In this episode, I finally got to meet Paul and learn how things have changed since those first days 12 years ago. His bakery has undergone a lot of changes, not least of which included swapping out the brick oven for a state of the art _wood fired_ (!) deck oven and pulling back to serving Gabriola Islanders exclusively.

It’s a compelling story and has me dreaming of forests and ferries again. Enjoy the show!
