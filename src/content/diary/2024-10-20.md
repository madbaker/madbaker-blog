The rain continued today and we spent most of it indoors doing laundry and jigsaw puzzles.  But in the morning Cindy's phone said we had a 45 minute window before the rain came again, so we headed out around Laurel Point and down Dallas Road.

My mind was troubled, thinking of the implications of a provincial election that was far too close.  People aren't happy, but it hurts me to see nearly half the folks want a change where they feel better by hurting others. I may not know much about life, but I know it's not a zero sum game.  

I couldn't shake the dark thoughts and Cindy finally made me sit on the benches by the Breakwater and breathe for a bit.  I focused on the sailboats toodling about on a calm sea, with the mountains across the water shrouded in thick fog along the shoreline.  My mind was chaos but the world around me was calm.  Slowly, I matched the calm around me and we walked home, as the rain started to fall, fine mist followed by larger and larger drops.  We scrambled across the street and got inside just before the skies opened for real.
