At long last, I returned to Beacon Hill Park for a winter update.  The occasion was a visit by my friends Chris and Amy from California.  I met them at their hotel and we wandered over so I could show off our local gem, even in the off-off-season.

It was a lovely day.  Cool, slightly overcast, but still with pockets of pale sunshine.  A perfect day for walking about.  We went through the 'native' section at the north end of the park, stopping to see the Arbutus and Garry Oaks and rocky outcroppings, before shifting to the formal gardens.  There were very few flowers but lots and lots of greenery.  The flower beds are bare except for a single ring of winter primulas, so the big trees have to carry the show.  They do a great job.  

Amy loves ducks and there were plenty to see, but the turtles were deep in their winter mud homes and the peacocks were taking shelter as well.  Even the Olympic Mountains were covered up in thick cloud.  But that's OK, we all had a wonderful time before hunkering down at the Beagle Pub for a hot lunch.
