Working day today so I never made it outside until mid afternoon and that was for a short loop with Cindy to buy peanut butter and salsa verde (not for the same dish!) It was nice to get outside.  It was a perfect summer day - low 20s, clear skies and no wind.  It feels like I haven't checked the James Bay gardens and book boxes in ages but it's only been a week.  The gardens are all good.  The book boxes were a little sparse. 

My garden is great.  Best it's ever been in August.  The new seedlings are all loving their new home, the peppers are growing and even the tomatoes are looking good.  No real movement from the gazanias but I'll be patient.
