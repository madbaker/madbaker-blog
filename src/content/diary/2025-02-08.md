It's Saturday, so that means adventure day!  It was generally cloudy, still quite chilly, but nice enough for Cindy and me to take the bus up to Hillside Mall to buy cat food, then take a stroll back home with a couple of stops for food.  First stop was Quadra Village for Bahn Mi sandwiches for lunch, then over to Deer and Dough for special Hot Chocolate Festival drinks with Garnet and Elanna.  Set aside that I ate a shocking amount of food in a short period of time, it was a brilliant day.

Our walk from Hillside to Quadra Village was on side streets that ended up taking us to the top of Cedar Hill.  It was a gentler climb than coming straight up Cook Street, and we saw a few very nice Mark and Cindy sized houses.  That is to say, in-law suites in the back yards of larger homes!  I doubt we could afford even a granny suite, but that's OK.  They're fun to look at.
