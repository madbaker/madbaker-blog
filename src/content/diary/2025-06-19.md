The wind keeps on blowing, but still, the garden survives.  I'm noticing the lack of heat is affecting the tomatoes most; lots of stem growth but not many leaves or flowers yet.  And the leggier they get, the more the wind blows.

My peas are much better off.  I see a lot of pods forming and slowly filling out.  I hope to be eating my first peas in a week.  And a hummingbird keeps checking to see if the peas have anything good to drink inside the flowers.

I did a double session of lawn bowling, practicing in the morning and then bowling in the afternoon draw.  It was nice to get out there after the excesses of Sunday's tournament.  But I miss a proper nature walk and need to give that a priority soon.

In the evening I walked to the Vic to watch the excellent documentary [#skoden](https://www.skoden.film/).  Leaving the theatre, I was struck by how cold it was outside.  I fear some wild weather is on the way.
