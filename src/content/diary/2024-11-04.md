Woke up to pelting rain that cleared by 9am and was replaced by gale force winds gusting down Douglas Street.  All the leaves are off the red oak now, and I had to retrieve all my pots and watering cans from the balcony before they flew down the street.

I made it outside in the afternoon long enough to get groceries, but I didn't see much.  My main goal was staying firmly on the sidewalk.  The wind kept up until evening.  I'll check the state of my garden in the morning.  One broccoli looks quite battered, but the rest of the plants seem to be OK.
