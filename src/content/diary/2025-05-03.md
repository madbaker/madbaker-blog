Ben is in town so we went for a walk to the James Bay Farmers Market and then downtown to a local artisan market.  We didn't go too far because he's still in a walking boot with a healing achilles tendon, but it was a lovely, fresh, cool but sunny day and it was a wonderful time.  

It was the first market of the year so I went a little crazy, buying coffee beans I didn't really need, an unplanned tomato plant and various snacks.  Great fun.
