I ran out of day today.   It was one of those rare days where my to-do list is longer than the hours I had to use.  I used them all today.

I got out for a walk after lunch to pick up a library hold and then meandered back to Cook Street for a roasting chicken at Root Cellar.  The sun was out again (is that five days in a row now?) so I took a bunch of side streets and stayed on the sunny side.  

As I walked down Su'it street I spotted a deer crossing the sidewalk in front of me.  They had a partner on the opposite sidewalk.  As I came closer there was a crash as a third deer stumbled out of the yard across the street, down over the stone retaining wall, having been chased out by a lady on the ground floor apartment the deer had chosen for lunch. 

Quite the scene, as the lady was rather small and the deer rather large.  But the lady was having none of it, and was not at all concerned to be seen outside wearing one of those old lady nightgowns (day-gowns? It was 2pm after all.)  There were potted plants to be protected and steps needed to be taken.
