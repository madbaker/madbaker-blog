Up and at 'em early this morning to catch a bus to Sidney, this time to help my friend Leah at her bakery.  She bought a deck oven that turned out to be convection, with no dampers, and worried it would be challenging to bake good bread in an over like that. 

It was a cool, cloudy, misty morning.  I hopped on the 72, the slower bus that diverts through Saanichton and a few other back roads.  It was a lovely ride, at times through fog, at other times overlooking a dark, grey sea.  The thickest clouds were on the mainland, obscuring everything but the closest gulf islands.

There are more and more signs of autumn.  It must be cooler at night once you get out of downtown, because the tops of the trees are starting to sport more and more red leaves. Nothing too drastic yet, but the trend is only in the cooler direction.

I saw an eagle again, possibly the same one I saw on Friday's bus ride, hovering above the vegetable fields near Michel's farm.  And the fields north of Saanichton were full of cows having their breakfast.  Saanichton is a beautiful area, a grown-up fantasy land with pretty farms and new, squat apartment buildings.  The price tags are the only thing to blow up the fantasy.

On the ride home, I made sure to look closely as we passed Elk Lake.  The lake was full of rowers out training in singles, pairs and fours.  The Olympics are over but they are still training full out, it seems.
