Partly it's the season, and partly it's Cindy being back at work, but weekends are awkward.  I think we both wanted a Big Adventure today but ended up toodling around town instead.  Weekends will require more planning from now on.

We did get out for two walks, however.  One was utilitarian -- a walk up to Bulk Barn to resupply our dry goods.  After lunch, we set out through Beacon Hill Park, along Dallas Road and back home through Fairfield.  The sun was out and our sweaters got packed away quickly.  It wasn't high adventure but we got some good conversation in.

My only pet peeve with bike rides, aside from my bad back, is that we can't talk while we're riding.  I mumble and Cin can't hear.  To be fair, I'm huffing and puffing too.  We connect better on foot, even though it doesn't help our heart and lungs as much.

A note about Beacon Hill.  I groaned a bit when they planted the summer flower beds.  Long, precise rows of 4-5 varieties, stretching off into the distance.  But my goodness have they ever filled in.  It's a solid mass of blooms now.  I don't know what they feed the plants to bloom like that, but it sure is impressive.
