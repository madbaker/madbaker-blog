I am getting into the habit of watching the sun rise against the east walls of the Empress Hotel and the museum.  It's a good habit.  A spirit lifting habit.  This run of cold, sunny weather is perfect.

I had my pottery class in the afternoon and decided to walk out to Cedar Hill.  It took around 75 minutes to get there, with a stop at Fernwood Coffee for beans.  It was lovely.  Nothing remarkable about the wildlife or plant life today, but what I noticed was that it was intensely quiet once I left North Park, and especially as I crossed Bay Street into Oaklands.  The only sounds were birds, the footfall of another pedestrian, and the plunk of tennis balls as I approached the courts at Shakespeare Park.  Oaklands is really growing on me.
