I woke up to cold, dark skies so settled in for a day of inside work.  Tidied up, did some cooking, and generally toodled about.  But in the afternoon the skies cleared and I dropped everything and ran outside.  

Sunny patches of the day are fleeting this time of year, and I felt real anxiety that I was going to miss out as I was in the middle of three different jobs.  But I made it out OK.  I walked through Beacon Hill Park.  The seasons have changed there quite dramatically.  The big flower beds are all dug up, replaced with a few winter hardy varieties and (I assume) spring bulbs.  City crews are in the park, replacing and repaving sections of the walking path.  The turtles were out, soaking up whatever sun they could find.

I headed on to Dallas Road and spend a good long time watching an eagle perched on top of the Tallest Totem Pole on the south side of the park.  There were two of them, taking turns on the tiny top of the pole.  It seemed like friendly sharing to me.
