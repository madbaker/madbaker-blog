_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

We're scrambling to get ourselves to Regina on Thursday.  Today we took Robyn to the airport in the early morning (she's heading to Saskatchewan ahead of us.)  She got her final look at misty Pacific waters for at least another year.   

Other than that, the only nature was out our apartment window.  Lots of work to do before we leave.  Getting the podcast in shape, making sure the BLC folks are in good shape, making sure there's enough toilet paper on hand, that kind of thing.
