The seminar yesterday pushed a few appointments to Friday, so I was in the house most of the day.  It was a cold one, cloudy, windy and chilly.  In the afternoon I went to the dentist for a quick adjustment and tried my best to pick a path out of the wind. It appears it's time to add one more layer to my repertoire.

In garden news, my first planting of spring bulbs are poking out of the pot.  Is that normal?  I wonder if I planted them too shallowly.  The cooler weather is really helping the spring broccoli, however.  One plant especially is looking strong and vigourous with plenty of new growth.  And the gazanias keep making flowers, even if there isn't enough sun for them to fully open.  This garden just keeps on giving my joy. 

It's been a hectic couple of weeks.  It feels like I've actually been working and not lazing about, taking in the nature all around me.  Tomorrow promises to have some proper adventure in it.
