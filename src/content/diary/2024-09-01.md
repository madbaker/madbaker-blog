Today was a 'round the house' day.  Cindy went for a walk with a friend, but I stayed back and got some projects done. Made a nice paper diary for myself so that was fun.  And then it was laundry and grocery time.  September means Back to School, which means Back to Work for Cindy, so it's time to find the autumn rhythms.

And still, without a proper walkabout, I saw two amazing sights.  First, a hummingbird nearly flew into the apartment.  The big balcony door was open as it flew around the garden, paused right in the doorway and then checked out the tomato plants and flew off.  It appeared to be a solid bluish grey colour, but I was so enthralled by its appearance in my doorway that I didn't get a good look.  What a thrill!

On the way back from groceries, we spied our two deer neighbours again.  This time they were in the park behind St. Ann's, just a block east of where we saw them yesterday.  Glad to see they still have plenty to eat.  The antlers on the young buck look especially hard and spiky this time of year.
