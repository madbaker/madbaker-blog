Cindy and I got our housework done in the cool, misty morning, then after we had lunch and the mist burned off, we set out for adventures.  Found some page protectors at Supply, went to an awesome 'small press' fair where I learned about risography, stopped at Legacy Gallery to take in the current installation, then walked over Johnson Bridge for a walk along the harbour.  

It was another beautiful day.  Lots of folks out strolling along in the sunshine.  We spotted a very large sea otter right along shore.  He had a fish in his mouth and was looking for a place to land and have lunch.  This was one big otter too.  Not the cuddly mamma with a baby on her stomach.  This fella meant business.

We stopped at the Empress on the way home so I could show Cindy the flowers.  The grounds were packed with cruisers, but we found a less trodden path and stopped to smell the flowers.  I was surprised when my plant app came back as 'dahlia' for most of the flowers.  The variety was vast, from huge frilly blooms to tight twillery to simple elegance.  They're all on the juice but my golly they look good.
