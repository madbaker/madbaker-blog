Friday the 13th.  That seems ominous.  All that is happening here is a wind warning and rain later in the day.  I got out for a walk around Cook Street before the worst of the weather hit.  But generally stayed indoors and worked on a few stamp projects.

Cindy wasn't so lucky.  She had the rain to contend with on her ride home. But then we hunkered down for our Friday shows and warmed up.
