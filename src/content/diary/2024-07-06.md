The combination of heat wave and a very long Zoom chat with Robyn meant that we didn't get out for much of a walk today.  Made it down to [L'Authentique](https://www.lauthentiquepoutineandburgers.com/) for a lunch so late it was more of an early supper and watched a Great Blue Heron flying across Inner Harbour.  I assume he was heading to their nest in Beacon Hill Park.  

On the way home we tried out a few plant identification apps, but were already wilting from the heat so ran inside and took shelter in a darkened room with two fans running.  thank goodness it cools off at night.  Forecast is for at least two more days of this heat.
