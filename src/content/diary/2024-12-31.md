Perhaps it was the skating that caused it.  Cindy went to bed with a cough and woke up with a cough and a fever.  So we stuck around home for the most part.

I got out in the afternoon for a year end walk, to the Birdcage, to the library, to the print shop, but otherwise took care of my sweet baboo.  It was dark and grey but dry, so the fresh air was a treat.
