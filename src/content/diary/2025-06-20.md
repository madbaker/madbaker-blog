In the morning I took a bus out to View Royal for a stamp club board meeting out near the General Hospital.  I rode on the Blink to Langford which meant getting dropped off along the highway, but it was a short and pleasant walk to the meeting place.  I saw a large bird soaring off in the distance, likely a vulture but large enough to be an eagle.

Leaving the meeting, I was surprised to see rain falling.  It hasn't rained in ages.  Any moisture is appreciated this time of year.
