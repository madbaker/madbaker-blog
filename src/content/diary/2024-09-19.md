I had work to do in the morning but made it out for a walk in the afternoon.  Today I went across the bridge to Vic West to gaze at the mountains from a different angle.  The City has done a wonderful job building a sitting area right at the base of the bridge, looking out at Inner Harbour and I took advantage of it.  It was a gloriously sunny day and the harbour was full of water taxis and float planes, with the Legislature across the way and the Olympics further off in the distance.

It was a short but enjoyable stroll.  When I got home I did some work in the garden.  My big tomato plant is pretty much ready to pull up.  I think the tomatoes would ripen faster indoors and the leafless stalks are pretty ugly.

The flowers, on the other hand, are stellar.  I spun one planter around because the African Daisy is going to bloom again and I want a close up view.  And the cosmos refuse to fade.
