I made it out for two walks today.  The first was a short jaunt from the bus stop on Hillside to Cedar Hill Rec Centre.  It's a bit of join born from inconvenience.  The bus route I normally take changed schedules so I can't get dropped off right in front of the Rec Centre anymore (at least not at 9:30AM.)  But the 15 minute walk from Hillside is wonderful.  It's a narrow residential street with some lovely gardens and lots of traffic controllers to prevent drivers from screaming down at high speed.  

I saw a new flower.  Tiny pink blooms on the end of long, thin, grassy stalks.  Beeblossom, a species of Evening Primrose, according to my app.  They look lovely in the morning too.

Later in the afternoon, I made a quick run to the store for some green veg for supper.  I had a quick standoff with a brown rabbit on the way.  Tiny and fluffy as opposed to the long, rangy jackrabbits in Saskatchewan, but I know they'd gouge my eyes out if they got a chance.  Rabbits can be vicious and don't let anyone tell you differently.
