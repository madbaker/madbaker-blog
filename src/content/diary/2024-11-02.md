The start of November is the start of craft sale season, and we jumped right in.  There are several sales every weekend for the next six weeks leading up to Christmas.  The bigger sales are still to come, but now is the time to find the smaller sales in the more interesting venues.  And since we don't buy very much, it is more about checking out the venues.  So we got a car and drove out to Prospect Lake, Cordova Bay and Strawberry Vale before heading back downtown for a craft sale and perogy lunch at the Ukrainian Club. 

It was a perfect day, really.  Cool and dark but the rain stayed away until we got home at 3pm.  It's rained so much this month. It's quite glorious actually.  Prospect Lake community hall is set deep in the woods, so it feels and smells like camping.  They even had some propane fire pits going beside the hall. 

And the big news is that I found my favourite Christmas fruitcake vendor at the very first sale!  I am now the proud owner of a two pound Christmas cake that I will enjoy, bit by bit, for the next two months.  (who am I kidding -- it will take three days once I start!  But I'm holding off for now.)
