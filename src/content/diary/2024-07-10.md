Stamp meeting in the morning and then the second Euro semi-final at noon, so there wasn't much nature at all until very late in the day.  We walked through Beacon Hill Park, stopping to watch a flock of baby ducklings paddle across the pond, then along Dallas Road to Cook Street.  

It was a beautiful evening.  The heat wave is starting to break, with the evenings cooling off considerably.  Good news for people and non-people as well.  I had to wear a long sleeved shirt for the first time all week.

The highlight of the walk was seeing a pea-hen with a little one, walking up the steps of Shenanigan's Bookstore on Cook Street!  So cool.  There are peacocks all around Beacon Hill but I've never seen them in the business areas.
