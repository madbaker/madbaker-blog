October.  Back to work for Cindy and back to work for me too, I guess.  Rain was in the forecast so I headed out to the grocery store in the morning to pick up the week's hard goods.  

I'm not always the brightest light in the string. When I got home and tried to put the toilet paper away, I realized I bought paper towel by mistake.  I just thought the rolls were extra thick.  I didn't realize the error until I tried prying apart two 'rolls' and finally noticed they were all once piece.  Yeesh.

What I did get correct was buying two small boxes of spring bulbs for the balcony.  They are already planted in one of the tomato pots.  I'll try to forget about them now so I can be surprised in spring.
