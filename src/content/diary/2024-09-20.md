Lots of frustration today working on an essay that is falling flat, but I took off after lunch for a stroll.  When in doubt, seek out the flowers.  I returned a few library books, then went to the Mexican market for tortillas.  Another glorious autumn afternoon.  I think it went up to 17C today.  Sweater and shorts combo weather.

The big news is that I picked a ripe, red sweet pepper for supper today.  They are small. I don't think I got more than two tablespoons of flesh from one fruit, but it tasted good.  It's tough to grow peppers and tomatoes in this climate, on a west facing balcony.  They really need a greenhouse here.  So I'm thrilled with what we got this year.
