The morning was clear with a glorious sunrise, but there is cloud and rain in the forecast, so Cindy and I set out before 10AM for a walkabout.  Cin isn't anywhere near full health, so we took it slow and stayed close to home.  Just a stroll down Belleville, up Menzies and back home via Michigan Street.  It was plenty long enough for Cindy.

I haven't walked by Inner Harbour for a bit, so it was nice to see the sailboats bobbing in the calm, slightly breezy water.  The boats change over, so I know that people use them, but I never see them coming in and out of their parking spaces (what's the nautical term for a parking space?)  

The natural highlight of the walk was a seagull having a big drink and a shower at the fountain beside the 'provinces' monument on Menzies. He was having a grand old time and was extremely thirsty.

As I write this, only an hour after coming home, most of the blue sky has been replaced by grey, thick clouds.  The wind is blowing my broccoli about.  Looks like we made the right decision to head out early.
