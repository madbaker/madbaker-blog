No calls today so I puttered around the apartment doing various odd jobs before heading out for a walk through Beacon Hill Park.  The weather is a bit chilly in the morning but once the sun came out in the afternoon it was proper shorts weather.

The rhododendrons in the park are stunning.  I hadn't noticed how each bush blooms at a different time.  The very early bushes are long past flowering, so I thought their time was over, but their neighbours are now lush and colourful, with wildly interesting colours. They are real show ponies though, compared to the elegant simplicity of the camas that grow wild underneath these showy monsters.
