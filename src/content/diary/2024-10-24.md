I left the apartment early to attend a seminar called 'Cultivating Safe Spaces' at the Dock.  It was excellent.  Truly interesting, inspiring and I left with my head full of ideas for my own work.  And the best part was meeting real live local people interested in the same topic.  

I walked home along the harbour, soaking in the sun and the sound of seagulls, the mountain peaks just poking through the distant clouds.  The world seemed full of beauty and possibility.
