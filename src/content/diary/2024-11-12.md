Today was the final day of Bakery Leadership Circle #2, so I needed a walk after an emotional Bonfire call.  I headed around James Bay, taking the long way to the grocery store, looking for birdsong and deer and finding both.  The forecast is for rain and high winds again, so I did my best to take advantage of the small window nice weather.

By nightfall, which came before I even thought about making supper, the winds were picking up.  Hopefully everything stays on the balcony tonight.
