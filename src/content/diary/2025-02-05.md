It was sunny and cold this morning and I took a chance and went up to the stamp meeting.  When I arrived I was the only customer at the cafe.  No tennis players, no indoor walkers, nothing.  I was just about to leave when Cheryl came in and then, in dribs and drabs, the rest of the crew came in, about 10 people in all.  So we stayed late and had a good visit.

I ended up getting a ride home with Bill, after a stop in at the Victoria Literacy Connection.  So very little walking today. The sidewalks are still icy in spots so that may be for the best.  Slowly, the skies are clearing and the temperature dropping a bit. It's going down to -3C overnight, which is cold for here.   They're getting -42C nights in Regina, so I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying that I feel the difference.
