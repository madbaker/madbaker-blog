Errands got in the way of a proper walk, which is disappointing because it was a clear, mild, sunny day all day.

I ran off to the bus in the morning, then had a bit of a stroll to the rec centre, which was brilliant.  Crisp and clear, with the sun cresting over the top of the eastern houses.  Not actual frost on the ground, but frosty.  I got to the rec centre on time, but far too early.

I should've walked home from there, but it was a cat food day, and I don't have the energy to hump four dozen cans of cat food on my back for an hour.  Maybe that can be my summer goal.

The sun is still shining as I write this, but quickly dropping behind the tower in James Bay.  The sunshine on the blooming daffodils in my balcony garden makes my heart sing.  And the healthy (as best I can tell) spring broccoli has me grinning.  Good day today.

If the sun's still shining tomorrow I shall burst out of the house at the crack of dawn.
