Saturday turned into a 'catch-up' day, where we got our laundry done and picked up the bulkier groceries.  But we made it into an adventure by walking out to Quadra Village and got groceries from Fairway Market.  It's usually where we go when we want Asian condiments, but this time it was for staples.  We stopped at a Vietnamese restaurant for lunch which was excellent.

The sun was out and it was a glorious autumn afternoon again.  So far the rains are coming overnight or in the morning.  The urban wildflowers along the fence lines are as colourful and robust as in July, although the huge sunflowers in front gardens are done for the year.  We can tend to our plants, but nothing beats what grows naturally.

On the way home, we took a good look at Crystal Pool and the proposed replacement plans.  One option basically destroys the active, mature parkland all around the pool.  A terrible, cynical option which the neighbourhood is understandably fighting against.

PS - I'd be remiss if I didn't share a photo of the single funniest carrot I have ever grown.  I'm now in search of a contest to enter it.
