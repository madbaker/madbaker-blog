The crisp, clear, sunny days are still with us, although we stayed around home for the most part.  We need one day per week to take care of business at home.

In the afternoon, I couldn't stand it any more, so I went out for a stroll along the harbour and Wharf Street. From our window, I thought I saw a new rocky pier in the harbour, but upon closer inspection nothing has changed.  So I still don't know what all the construction near the ferry terminals is all about.

I stopped in at Value Village and did a bit of shopping on the walk home, but the stroll was more about soaking up the sunshine.  And I did that, very well.
