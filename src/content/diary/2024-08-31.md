Hot one today.  We had a call with Ben in the morning and then headed out for a spot of lunch and then to pick up a few groceries for supper.  Downtown is packed.  Cruise ship traffic, long weekend tourists and a pile of folks in town for a BC Lion 'neutral site' CFL game.  So my nature walk was of the 'human nature' sort once again.  

Although on the walk home, we did spot two deer grazing in the submerged walkway of the government building on Superior Street.  There's a row of 'basement suite' style offices in the building with an unused walkway outside their windows.  Both sides of the walkway are covered in vines and other plants so the deer were having a field day.  

The deer won't have to leave until they are full.  I don't think the office workers will even notice them.  It's a good hiding spot for unhoused folks to get some private sleep too, and I suspect the deer will be willing to share the space if needed.
