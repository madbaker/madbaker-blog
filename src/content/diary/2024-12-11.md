Off to Cedar Hill today.  I intended to walk there and bus back with 50 cans of cat food, but I loafed about in the morning and bussed both ways.  Thank goodness the bus goes nowhere near the Rec Centre, as I had another lovely walk through Oaklands.

I was reflecting on Chris and Amy potentially moving here as I checked out the houses along Gosworth Street.  There are worse places to live than Oaklands, that's for sure.  Reasonably sized houses, some with cute inlaw suites in the back, birds singing even in December, the odd deer deciding what to eat.  It was a cool, peaceful, hopeful morning.

I seem to be stockpiling for the holidays.  Today was cat food an securing a birthday gift for Cindy.  There will be more in the days ahead.
