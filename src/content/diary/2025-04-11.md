It was a nice day out and I should have done more outdoors, but I have a project to finish so stuck around home and got it done.  

I went out for a quick stroll around noon and ended up in the middle of the only rain of the day.  Slight drizzle as I left the building, then big, heavy drops splatting on my by the time I got to Government Street.  I dodged in and out of doorways for a few blocks until the rain stopped and the sun came out in force.
