It was an actual Snow Day today.  Cindy was off work and we took advantage of the weather to stay inside and bake. I made burger buns and Cin made some applesauce cake.  Fun and relaxing, but all indoors.

In actual fact, we didn't get much snow where we live.  The roads were clear but frosty, there was enough snow to cover the grass but not much more than that.  Certainly not a drift situation.  The most snow we saw was on vehicles driving into downtown. But higher elevations, even around Cedar Hill, were dealing with more snow and icy conditions.

I pulled my pot of daffodils inside because they were getting weighed down, but put them back outside the next morning.  I don't want them blooming because they warmed up indoors.
