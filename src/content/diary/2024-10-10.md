Another day full of errands.  Lots of cooking, cleaning and bike repair.  I fixed up Cindy's flat tire and patched some old tubes too.

I hiked over to Fairfield Cycle for a patch kit in the afternoon during the peak sunny part of the day.  My quest for pots for winter garlic was solved too, as there was a huge pile of plant pots on the curb near Linden Street.  Someone must have totally redone their garden.  I took six 6" pots for the balcony.  Now all I need is compost and bulbs.  The perfect weekend quest.

We're planning some longer hikes and bikes for the upcoming Thanksgiving weekend, but this time of year I am loving the shorter "errands" walks too.  There's so much greenery here that I always feel like I'm in the middle of a park.  Even when I have to go deep into downtown, I can always get a few blocks in along the harbour.  I'm a lucky guy.
