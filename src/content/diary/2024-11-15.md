Sunny!  It's sunny!  Sunny and crisp.  +3C as ol' Sol first shone between the buildings.  I had a call in the morning but rushed outside the very second the call ended, without lunch or anything.

Unfortunately, I left without my toque, which would have come in handy.  It was brisk, for sure.  I headed over to Cook Street and then towards Dallas Road and just like in summer, the air cooled as I got closer to the water.  Even though the sky was brilliant blue above me, the mountains were covered in fog and cloud, so I tucked back inland to the shelter of Beacon Hill Park.  You can tell we've had lots of rain as the grass is downright spongy.  

I stuck to the hard paths and breathed in the musky scent of damp cedar.  Commiserated with the ducks.  Left the peacocks with their heads tucked under their wings for warmth.  Kept turning my face towards ol' Sol as best I could.  Brightened my spirits, then headed for home and a mug of hot tea.
