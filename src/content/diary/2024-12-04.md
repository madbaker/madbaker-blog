I rushed out of the apartment to catch a bus to Cedar Hill.  My head was full; messages to send, appointments to keep, winter art classes to book.  It took me the entire bus ride to get my head sorted and when I stepped off the bus I was in another world.  Hillside and Gosworth, an intersection of thick fog and mystery.

I crossed the street and headed down Gosworth in silence.  The clouds in the distance almost touched the street.  There were a few other people about and we nodded in passing as if to say, let's keep an eye out for each other.  I was expecting a stag to come bounding out of a side garden, at minimum.  A wolf felt more likely.

I have several options when walking to the Rec Centre, but this is my favourite.  The streets are exceptionally quiet and I can get lost in thought.  Nothing leapt out at me today, but the anticipation was enough.

By the time I wanted to head home, the fog had burned off and the sun was out in force.  I took a bus to Chinatown so I could check in at UP, then had a leisurely walk home along the harbour.  It's one of those perfect sunny winter days in off-season.  Not many people about so I can slow down, look around and breathe deeply.  So that's exactly what I did.
