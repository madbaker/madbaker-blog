We're both sick today.  Her cold is slowly getting better and mine is getting worse.  So we stayed inside all day.  I didn't even get any groceries.  

But the morning was brilliant, because as I sat in my chair and felt sorry for myself, a hummingbird came to visit me.  He fluttered all around the balcony garden, checking out the flowers and tomatoes and then hovered in front of the open patio door as if deciding whether to come inside.  I got a long look at this small miracle before he took off for sweeter pastures. 

I smiled to myself, grabbed another blanket and hunkered down with a book for the day.  All was good in the world after all.
