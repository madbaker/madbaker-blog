Off to Cedar Hill this morning for the muffin meetup and then home on foot through Oaklands and Fernwood.  It's another glorious spring day so I lingered over the flowers and plants along the route.

The early flowering plum trees are all done with flowering and beginning to leaf out, starting with red leaves that will eventually turn green somehow.  And the Japanese cherry trees are in full flower.  I kept skipping from back and forth across the street to get close to the blossoms or check out a particularly interesting flower bed.

I've also been looking at bamboo plantings, to see if I might find a species that will grow in pots on my balcony.  I have an idea for a bamboo windbreak if I can find the right combination of heavy pot and miniature bamboo plant.
