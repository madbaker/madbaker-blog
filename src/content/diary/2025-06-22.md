Even though my walking mate is away, I headed out for a decent stroll in the afternoon, around James Bay, past the community garden, then back through Beacon Hill Park.  It was breezy and chilly, and I didn't bring a jacket, so I avoided Dallas Road and the extra-cool breezes off the ocean.  

It was nice to get out for a walk again. The park was full of people; there was a picnic wedding in one area, and a massive group of young adults (possibly a church group?) singing and playing games in another area.  Plus the usual crush of tourists, locals, pedicabs and cars trying to turn around at every dead end and cul-de-sac.  I watched a few overs of cricket, checked in on the herons, and headed for home.

I'm impressed by the progress of the veggies at the community garden in James Bay.  They have overtaken my balcony garden in all respects.  I'm just not getting enough sun.
