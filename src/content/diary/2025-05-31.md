Saturday!  Festival Day!  Today was a Japanese Market over in Fernwood so we headed there after lunch.  It was a challenging walk.  The morning was dark and rainy, and it was still cold and cloudy as we left.  But the skies cleared and the wind picked up as we approached the Fernwood neighbourhood.  This cold-hot-cold cycle is dangerous for me -- I get sweaty, then chilled and eventually bonk.  It's a terrible feeling and I was a right mess just as we paid our fee and entered the community centre.  I started out woozy then, once confronted with too much scent, too many people and not enough airflow, I nearly fainted.  Thankfully, a few minutes in the open courtyard and I got my body back to normal.

By the late afternoon, the winds were howling and the balcony garden was leaning hard to the right.  The peas nearly blew right off the trellis.  Ridiculous.  Cindy is talking about setting up a trellis behind the bamboo to further divert the wind but I fear nothing will shelter the garden when the winds start howling off the water and funneling down Douglas Street.
