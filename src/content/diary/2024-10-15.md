It was a rainy one today so I stuck inside the apartment for most of it.  In the afternoon, I saw a break in the clouds and went off to the grocery store for a piece of fish.  

The rain had somehow cleared the mist off the Olympic Mountains so you could see the patches of snow on the peaks and a bit of depth to the scene.  The usual view of the mountains are a solid blue-grey outline.  

Other than that, it was an indoor day.  A hummingbird came by to check in on me, and even took a drink from a gazania flower, but that was about it.
