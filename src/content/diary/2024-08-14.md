_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

One more run to Thrifty foods was the sum total of my outdoor time today.  But the house is clean and fully stocked and our bags are packed. 

A highlight was finally meeting our housesitters Thomas and Virginie, a lovely young couple from France.  They've been in Canada for over a year now and had many stories to tell.  We talked until far too late, especially as our taxi picks us up at 3:30AM tomorrow!
