Dark and cloudy one today.  Cindy was sick in bed and I tried my best to be a decent caregiver.  My only outing of the day was to pick up a few healing aids and drop off library books.  The drizzle was just heavy enough to require an umbrella a block or two.

In the evening I took a car to the stamp club meeting.  It was already well dark before I left home, but I saw my main wildlife of the day; two large deer crossing in front of me.  They were far enough away to not cause problems with the car, but close enough that they were no longer silhouettes by the time I finished my approach.  Lots of woodland in Saanich, but these deer walked right into someone's front garden, between the hedges and under the arch.
