The clocks got pushed back by an hour so we woke up to a little more light.  Not too much more, because it was raining again.  We stayed inside, doing laundry and odd jobs around the house.  I roasted a chicken, we fogged up all the windows, and that was the day, really.

With the time change, sunset is before 5pm, so we really need to get outside in the morning from now on.
