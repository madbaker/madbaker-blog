Although I didn't plan it this way, today was all about phone calls, so I didn't get outside until well into the afternoon, and even then it was for a quick walk to the shops.  I'm taking all this weather warning stuff seriously enough to stock up before the weekend, where rain is promised and snow is a definite possibility 'in higher elevations.'   Is the fourth story high enough?

The birds know something is going on.  They were chirping more than usual as I ran off to the Birdcage, hands deep in my pockets, head pointed down.  That's all there was to it today.
