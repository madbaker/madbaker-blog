We were up far too late last night and had long to-do lists today, but the sun was shining so we set the lists aside and headed out for a long walk around Laurel Point.  Big rains again last night meant everything was fresh and green, as usual this time of year.  

We made our way around the point, past Fisherman's Wharf, and out to the Breakwater. The water was full of life.   We saw a flock of hooded mergansers at Laurel Point and another flock in the straight, all diving deep for food and popping up at the same time.  A seal was having fun on the other side of the point, and a huge sea lion was entertaining folks at the Breakwater, rolling and diving over and over.  We saw a huge sea otter along Dallas Road too.

Further inland, it was all about the James Bay front gardens.  The highlight was an enormous rosemary bush on Ladysmith Street.  It was nearly 5 feet high, even bigger around and smelled amazing.  I felt an overwhelming urge to roast a chicken for supper tonight.
