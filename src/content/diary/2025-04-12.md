Saturday!  Finally.  It was clear but very windy and Cindy and I decided to walk along the Esquimalt side of the harbour.  It was a blustery walk for sure but the flowers were lovely, the birds were singing up a storm and there weren't many others out and about, so we had a lovely time.  We spotted a seagull diving for crabs (successfully) and several cormorants on the piers.  But the highlight was at the very end of the trail, in West Bay, where we saw two bushtits in a cherry tree.  They had built a nest and were bringing more building material to the nest to reinforce their construction.

The birds were tiny and the next as delicate as could be. It looked like an old sock made up of loose dryer lint.  The building materials were the smallest stems from the blossoms and the whole nest swayed in the breeze.  But we could clearly see the entrance and the birds were so light they didn't move the nest at all as they worked inside.  So I guess it was perfect.
