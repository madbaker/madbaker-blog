Wild weather, still.  It can hail, rain, be sunny, be windy, in any combination, and change completely in 10 minutes.  We've changed plans due to rain just to see the sun come out as soon as we confirmed the change.  We've left a sun-filled apartment, walked downstairs and exited the building in a rain shower.  Very strange.

The majority has been heavy rain, however, so we stayed indoors, doing our spring cleaning. We're leaving for Saskatchewan in two days, so of course we're making the apartment move-in ready for my sister, who is house-sitting.  

So I spent the weekend cleaning and watching Gardener's World, which has started the new season.  Monty's had a wet spring too, from the look of things.  But he's optimistic that spring is ready to burst into bloom.  I'm optimistic too.
