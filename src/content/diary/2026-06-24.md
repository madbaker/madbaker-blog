Another bowls + shopping day.  I set out in the morning to scope out a few stores and was surprised at how warm and muggy it was.  There is still a lot of cloud around, so much that I can't remember the last time I saw blue sky, but today the temperature was at least five degrees warmer than during the past week.  

The afternoon bowls was a bit of a shambles (that is, my bowling was a shambles) and halfway through the breeze shifted and the temperatures immediately dropped back to yesterdays cool levels.  What is going on?  A few hours of wind made me think a storm was brewing but nothing came of it.

Sadly, the only nature in all of this was bidding farewell to two more lettuces, who succumbed to the cutworms.  That and I noticed a large group of crows camping out in the big oak tree in the evening.  They stuck around for at least an hour before moving on.
