Sunshine!  Glorious Sunshine! 

There were plenty of clouds today, but lots of sun too, so I went for a long park + errand walk around noon.  The ground crews were out in force in Beacon Hill Park, spreading manure mulch on as many beds as they could.

I noticed the heron nests are empty.  They must migrate south?  I'll keep an eye out for their return in the coming weeks.

There was plenty enough cloud cover, but pockets of warm sun, so I picked the sunniest path through the park, then back via downtown, my backpack loaded with supplies.

In the afternoon, I bussed out to Cedar Hill Rec Centre for my first winter pottery class.  The bus routes are odd enough that I still have a 15 minute walk, this time along McRae Avenue, to approach the facility from the north.  It was a lovely enough walk, still very light and mild.  But the class ended at 5:30PM and it was already pitch dark.  It's still winter, after all.
