The heat wave is here in full force.  Highs of +25C which really catches you out when you're not used to it.  We made the most of the heat by walking over to Beacon Hill Park for a picnic lunch.  Delicious shawarma bowls on a shady bench, beside a pond with a fountain.  Perfect.  We ate and talked and watched a hummingbird fly back and forth between the trees and the fountain spray.  It was having a good time from the look of it.

Today was also the Cook Street Block Party so we went for a look.  It was a crush of people, far more than make me comfortable, so we didn't stay long.  We saw a few interesting vendors but the only folks selling anything were the food trucks and beer gardens.
