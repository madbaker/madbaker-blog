Still feeling lousy but I got through my morning calls and the sun was calling to me by lunchtime.  So I put on my shoes, grabbed my backpack and set off for the grocery store and a couple of book boxes.  

The books boxes didn't pay off but the sun was warm and refreshing.  We must be between cruise ships because James Bay was quiet.  No buses, no cars, just a few folks out for a walk, or heading to the school to pick up their little ones.  There are still so many flowers in full bloom.  It's beautiful.

I stopped to consider the rosemary bush outside the local medical clinic.  There's so much new growth on it this year.  The top 8 - 12 inches are all fresh, tender shoots.  I'll keep that in mind the next time I want to roast a chicken.  Some selective pruning will help my supper and the plant.
