Out for an actual walk this afternoon, checking out the situation in Beacon Hill Park.  There was a stiff wind in my face and cloudy skies overhead, so it took all the way to the stone bridge for my mood to lighten and my eyes to raise up enough to look around.  What I saw were hundreds of ducks and geese and very few people.  

What do you call it when the ducks are muttering and talking to each other?  It's not a full quack, more of a ducky murmur.  The park was full of this murmuring.  I loved it.  It quieted my mind right down.  I need to replace my monkey mind with a murmuring duck mind.

The people picked up along Dallas Road.  It was a little sunnier there, but nothing that would cause me to stop and face the sun.  I tried to spot the mountains behind their clouds and carried on to Cook Street.  It was nice to get out, and once the wind was at my back, quite pleasant too.
