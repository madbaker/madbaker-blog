Cindy went on yet another hike with a friend and I stayed home to get caught up on work and emails.  But I got out for a walk through Beacon Hill Park in the afternoon.  

I lingered for a short time at the bandshell, listening to a rock/jazz/rap band and then watched fifteen to twenty overs of cricket.  I arrived just after the sixth wicket had fallen, then watched the batting team settle in and score 65 runs without the slightest chance of getting out.  Then a massive pop-up was dropped, my butt was sore from the hard metal benches, and I headed for home.

The park is a beautiful oasis in what can be a hot and noisy city.  It's peaceful even when it's crowded.  And I'm still spotting plants that are new to me.
