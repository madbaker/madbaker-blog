I was out early in a bright, warm Sunday morning to help a local bookstore move to a new location around the corner.  I spent two hours wheeling boxes and boxes of books and while I made a good dent in the stacks, I had to leave before the job was done.  There were lots of volunteers though, more than fit in the space if I'm honest, so I went hard and then staggered home.

In the afternoon, I picked myself up and headed out to run some errands with Cindy.  This is the first truly warm day of the year, clear all the way to the mountains and feeling much warmer than the 13C on the thermometer.  Proper shorts weather, at least until 5pm when the sun angle flattens and the sweaters come out.

The forecast is for highs of 17C this week.  Time to get serious about planting the garden.
