It rained overnight and well into the morning today.  The rain was very, very welcome.  The temperature has dropped quite a bit as well, causing me to don socks for only the second time this month.

My walk today was more of an errand, delivering a package to my friend Bill at his art studio downtown.  He's renting space in a divey little place by the bottle depot which is quite depressing to get to but quite lovely when you get inside. His tiny studio is packed solid with all kinds of stuff.  It's lovely.  

But since the location is in the worst part of the concrete jungle, with so many unhoused people huddled with all their possessions under every stray tree and bush on the block, I didn't linger.  There is nature even there, but it's being used.  Today I will stick to my balcony garden.
