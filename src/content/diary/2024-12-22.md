Two days into Christmas holidays and the days are starting to merge together.  Grey and windy outside, warm and cozy inside.  Another "Cindy Recovery Day."  We stuck close to home and read books for the most part. 

We decided to use today to get the housework done. Forecast is for a bit of sun in a few days so don't want to be shopping then.  So in the afternoon, we got a car and did the grocery loop out to Oak Bay, then ran home and did laundry as it started to rain again.

Not a lot of nature today.  It's all around us but I'm not observing like I should and am certainly not recording it.  I realize that.  It all ebbs and flows.
