Lovely crisp, sunny morning this morning so I headed out early with a backpack full of posters and a shopping list.  I traipsed all around James Bay and dropped off show posters at every library and community centre I could find, and posted them myself on every bulletin board.  Then I stopped at Thrifty Foods for the week's groceries.  The air was fresh and clear and I was breathing deep the entire time.

After lunch, I did the same thing but over on Cook Street.  First posters, then popping into Root Cellar for a sale chicken.  The cricket pitch has been given over to dog walkers for the winter, but the lawn bowlers were out in force, soaking up the sun.  Cook Street was lively.  I'm not the only one who races outside when the sun is shining.
