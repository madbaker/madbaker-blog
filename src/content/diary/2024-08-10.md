Saturday means market day so that's exactly what we did.  Robyn's knees prevented much walking but we made it to Moss Street market to buy the largest head of lettuce we've even seen and a small loaf of bread.  Pleasant, sunny summer morning, perfect for waiting in line for the good stuff.

Sadly, that was all of the outdoor bits for the day.  I miss walking about.  It's an important part of my day.  But family comes first.  I'll be back walking and writing and looking for nature again soon enough.
