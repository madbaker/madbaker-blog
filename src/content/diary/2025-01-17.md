A "free" day today.  I planned to do a lot of stamping but, as usual, didn't get to my desk until nearly supper time.  Too many odd jobs to do.

The sun was out, so I took a spin through James Bay to look at the book boxes, then aa spin around Beacon Hill.  Today is one of those days where I have to make up a destination; there are no errands left to run this week.  So I spent my time watching peacocks and admiring their blueness, and trying to will the rhododendrons to open up.  But they will open when they are good and ready, and it isn't today.

My balcony garden appears very happy.  The self watering pots are taking care of themselves, and the others need a small drink once per week.  The early growth of the bulbs with frilly leaves (I can't remember their name) has tapered off without any flower stems appearing, but the deeper planted daffodils are coming up, long green spikes now taller than the frills.  

I think my 'found' pots would've benefitted from more soil in them.  The garlic is sprouting but quite thin, I suspect they aren't getting enough light on the top of the soil.
