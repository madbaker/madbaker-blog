Nothing scheduled today so I baked some bread for Cindy and as soon as the loaves came out of the oven, set out for a pleasure walk.  I went through Beacon Hill Park, as usual.  No new flowers to report, but there's still a bit of ice on the pond, even though the picklers were balling in shorts on the sunny court.  The peacocks were plump and deeply blue.

As I got to Dallas Road, I spotted a bald eagle gliding in for a landing on the top of the Largest Totem Pole.  I missed the actual landing -- a tree blocked my view -- but it was there in all it's regal glory as I popped around the tree. 

The mountains were stunning today.  The peaks were clearly visible, but there was a band of dense, bright white foggy clouds right across their middles.  I've never seen a pattern like that and would love to try to paint it one day.

I also got the treat of seeing two hummingbirds having an aerial battle like two teeny jet fighters.  I'm sure they were just playing but the manuevers were intricate and a delight to watch.

And if that wasn't enough, I returned home to notice that my daffodils are forming flowers!  Several of the leaves aren't actually leaves; they're paler than the leaves and forming tiny pods on the top.  I'll be checking them closer now, waiting for the moment of first bloom.
