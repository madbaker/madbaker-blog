Today was my cat lady day -- on the bus to Walmart and Michaels to get cat food and yarn.  It was almost constant drizzle during the hours I was out; I needed to keep my glasses in my pocket while I was outside.  

The cherry blossoms at Uptown are all blown away and the trees are just starting to leaf.  Where there were once flowers there are now buds, popping green, on every tree and bush.

The big red oak tree out my balcony window is beginning to leaf out.  It's all furry and golden now, as the pre-leaves are like a shaggy golden moss. I can't remember if they drop off and are replaced by leaves or whether they change colour.  I will keep you posted.

For supper, we had a nice feed from the spring broccoli plant.  I steamed some stalks with green beans from the store.  Delicious!
