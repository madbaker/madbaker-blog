Today was a bit of an errand day.  I walked up to North Park for some scrap yarn and the grocery store for ice cream, then rushed home before the ice cream melted.  

Jobs done, I went for a longer walk around the neighbourhood.  The bearded irises are coming into bloom.  Each year I'm shocked by how big the blooms are here. The species I grew in Regina were much smaller; these big boys wouldn't survive the prairie winds.
