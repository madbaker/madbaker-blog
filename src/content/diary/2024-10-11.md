Another errands day.  What is going on this week?  Today the loop went library - copy centre - bank - along the harbour to James Bay - grocery store (butter on sale!) - church sale - convenience store and then home, all in a little over an hour.  I'm living the Mayberry life.

It's cool out.  +10C in the morning.  OK, a light jacket morning.  I saw a guy wearing ear muffs, standing beside a guy wearing shorts.  So, West Coast autumn.  

The big oak outside my window is now more red than green, but most of the leaves are still on the tree.  Autumn has a long way to go still.
