Cloudy day with much of the same forecast this week.  IT's not he end of the world but it certainly pushes my tomatoes back further.  I am starting to realize I only imagined the fruits changing colour.  They are as green as ever. Any orange I see is my hopeful tanned face reflected in the pure, 100% green skin.  At this rate, one tomato might be ripe by Labour Day.

It was a heavy work day followed by a heavy trip to the dentist, so I swapped all my nature walks for Advil and soft foods.  My only outdoor time was to and from the dentists office.  I shall have to find a dentist at the other end of Beacon Hill Park at this rate.

PS - Last night around 5pm I was sitting in my chair, talking with Cindy, when I realized I was hearing a jet airplane engine nearby.  That's odd since big planes don't fly anywhere near our apartment.  I mentioned it to Cin just as the entire Snowbirds troupe flew overhead, made three loops around inner harbour and then headed off toward the airport!  I haven't seen the Snowbirds in years and never expected to see them flying in Victoria.  Another sound of home.
