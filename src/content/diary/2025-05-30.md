I seem to have over done it with the lawn bowling this week.  My right knee is throbbing as if it's not used to doing 200 lunges in a week.  So, aside from a quick trip to the library and to Crust for baked treats for Cindy, the day was spent indoors with an ice pack.  

Even inside, there is nature news -- my cucamelon has germinated!  I planted two seeds each in two pots a week ago and the pot I kept indoors under plastic has sprouted.  No movement from the outdoor pot yet.
