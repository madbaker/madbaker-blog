Cindy's back at school so it's up to me to keep walking and watching.  I didn't do the best job today, as I spent the morning cleaning house.  But I did head out for a loop to the grocery store and the library.  

We're in prime West Coast spring weather, mostly sunny and cooler than you think. Layers are what save you when you head out, but it means you're carrying a full ensemble by the time you get home. 

There's been a new addition to our supper routine.  We sit down to eat right around the time the herons head back to their nests.  I'm tracking 2-3 birds flying from the harbour to the park through the kitchen window as we eat.  They start out looking like eagles or large gulls until you catch a view in profile and then they are distinctly herons, long necks tucked in above their chest, long legs trailing behind.  Very Pteradactyly.
