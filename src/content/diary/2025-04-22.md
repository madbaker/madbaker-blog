Earth Day today, which I spent pottering about on the balcony in between giving the apartment a good cleaning.  There are enough damp patches on the balcony that I clean the floor in shifts, moving everything to a clean spot, waiting for the exposed tiles to dry, then sweep up the last bits of compost and potting soil.  It's worth the effort, as I can now walk on the balcony in bare feet or socks and not track dirt onto the carpet.

I've noticed that by taking the wicker chair and my cooler 'side table' off the balcony, I now have space for at least five more pots.  That seems ominous!  Definitely next year territory though. I want to buy with more thought.  I went overboard with bulbs last fall and now have spent foliage to look at for a very long time.  Maybe it's time to think about more perennial plants.

In the afternoon, I took advantage of Earth Day free transit to head to Uptown for some shopping, and then went to Ship Point with Cindy for some Earth Day poetry readings.  You couldn't ask for a better afternoon: warm, clear, sunny and with a cool breeze coming off the water.  It was lovely.
