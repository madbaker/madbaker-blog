It was a cool and cloudy day, but I had a hankering for a hot dog so we hiked out to Willows Beach for lunch.  The walk to Willows is one where you have to look hard for the nature, especially the middle bit along Fort Street as it turns into Cadboro Bay road.  But we did our best, and lingered along the front gardens in Fairfield and Oak Bay.  

The weather is so weird.  Cool enough for a sweater until the instant the clouds break and then it's stonking hot.  So we changed clothes a every few blocks.

The beach itself was good fun, watching an old fellow using his windfoil out on the water and young boys filling a swing seat with rocks.  And the hot dog was pretty good too.
