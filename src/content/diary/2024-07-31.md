One month down in this diary.  It's been good to track all the nature available in summer on the island, even if work took more of my time than I would like.

Today was the perfect summer day.  Warm, but not overly hot, with lots of sun and a gentle breeze.  I had calls in the morning but after lunch met with my friend Heather who was visiting from Regina.  We had a lovely coffee outdoors in the shade then strolled around James Bay before she headed off to her homestay in Fernwood.  

It was nice enough to head back out later and pick up a few groceries and survey the book boxes.  No pickups today which is a good thing.  I'm well behind in my reading.
