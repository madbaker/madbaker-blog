Glorious, warm day today.  I went for a short walk at noon to pick up baked goods for Cindy, but spent the majority of the day in the garden.  I moved everything about in three stages and cleaned the balcony windows and floor so the entire space gleams.  The only problem was when I snagged my wash bucket on a high tile and dumped the dirty, soapy water all over, spilling most over the balcony edge while I frantically tried to stop the flow.

I've been eating the spring broccoli out of hand and it's delicious, and intend to cook the large stalk for supper.  Lightly steamed ought to do it.

It's time to start thinking of planting early vegetables.  Carrots, lettuce and peas can go it, but I need to move the bulb pots do make room for them. And what about summer bulbs?  And my bamboo windbreak?  I'm going to need a bigger balcony!
