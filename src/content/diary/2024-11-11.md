Remembrance Day.  For the first time in years we didn't go to the main ceremony.  The general mood is shifting so far to the right that I couldn't take a traditional military service. There's no nuance out here. All heroes and vanquished enemies and Jesus and the King.  No talk of peace and getting along with each other.

Instead, we donned our poppies and walked out to Oak Bay for groceries.  It was cool and slightly breezy, which is risky weather for me.  I tend to get sweated up, then catch a breeze and get an immediate, deep chill.  But I got my layers mostly right.  

More of nature's colourful bounty along the route.  I'm used to being knee deep in snow on this day.  But not on the island.
