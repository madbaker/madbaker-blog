Woke up feeling lighter and set off to Union Pacific at 5:30AM.  The birds were still singing and the power washers were replaced with street sweepers.  But it was a lovely morning and after the funk of yesterday, my mood was lighter.  

After work, I walked along the harbour toward James Bay to pick up a few groceries and check out the book boxes.  We're in the season of constant cloud cover, but today's clouds were high and light, so I walked tall and tried to catch as many diffuse rays as possible.  

Lots and lots of leaves and small twigs on the ground, from the season and Monday's storm.  Most boulevards have knee high piles of leaves in a long row, which makes jay walking extra fun.
