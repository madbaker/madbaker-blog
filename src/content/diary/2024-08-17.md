_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

It rained a bit overnight, but was still quite hazy in the morning.  The air quality rating is down from a 6 to a 4, which is still pretty bad.  But it's slightly fresher, and warmer as well.  

After visiting Dad in the morning we went back to Regina to get Robyn and bring her out for the day.  The combines were out in force along the highway.  I couldn't make out what they were harvesting but it was a fairly short crop.  Canola maybe?  All I know for sure is that they were kicking up a lot of dust.  It's difficult to have clear air in Saskatchewan this time of year.

After our second visit with Dad we went to Temple Gardens spa for a soak.  I'm not sure if we really needed hot springs on such a warm day but still, it was refreshing.  

I took a fleeting glance at Crescent Park on the drive back to the hotel; it's the gem of Moose Jaw but looked pretty stressed in the heat and dry weather.
