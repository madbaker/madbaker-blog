Oof.  9C and drizzly feels cold. It's a sweater and jacket day as I headed out to have coffee with Renee on Cook Street.  Warm room, good coffee, and a good visit all combine to put me in a good mood for the walk back home.  

I dodged water droplets from the trees above, chestnuts and leaves on the ground from the trees above, and squirrels gathering chestnuts to carry back to their nests in, you guessed it, the trees above.  Trees are mighty important.  We lose so many mature trees every year in the name of progress, but the tiny saplings that eventually replace them will never feed an ecosystem. At least not in our lifetime.  Soon there will be complaints about 'the squirrel problem'.  Will anyone acknowledge that they are only a problem because we took their homes in order to build our condos and airBnbs?
