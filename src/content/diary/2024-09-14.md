While Cindy headed off with friends for a day in Qualicum, I stayed back to bake some bread.  The cool, rainy morning is perfect for mixing dough and running our tiny, leaky home oven.

By the time the bread was ready, the skies had cleared and it turned in to a lovely sunny afternoon.  I headed out for a walk along Wharf Street, stopping at a few bookshops on the loop.

The flowers at the Legislature and in front of the Empress Hotel are still stunning, with no signs of fading yet.  Much of my 'experience' of autumn is in my head.  Yes, the days are getting shorter, but there is plenty of sunshine for mature plants to thrive.  So when I got home I looked at my garden with renewed interest and yes, it's true on my balcony as well.  The cosmos ae still blooming, the gazanias are as healthy as ever, and I'm seeing red on my peppers.  Lots more growing still to come.  

I got caught up on Gardener's World episodes and I guess things are still going strong in England too.  They keep talking about harvesting this vegetable in October, or some plants flowering in November.  That doesn't seem possible, but I've seen it in Victoria too, every year.  It may be close to first frost in Saskatchewan, but this sure ain't Saskatchewan.
