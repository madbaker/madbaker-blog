Snow is in the forecast, but today was still dry, so we headed out for a walkabout.  It was the usual route for me, but Cindy doesn't get to see Beacon Hill Park nearly as often, so we strolled through the park and I pointed out all my highlights.  Ice on the pond here, a peacock there, and so on.  Once we got to Dallas Road, the mountains were clear and lovely, but off north of us was a massive black cloud, so we turned up Howe Street and made our way home via Cook Street.

By nightfall (5:30PM, haha) the first flakes were starting to fall, just as we drove out to Esquimalt for Dine Around at the Saxe Point pub.  We had a table by the window, so got to watch the snow fall in small flakes, then tiny ice pellets, then larger flakes.  Not much staying on the ground, and as we drove home to a slightly lower elevation, no snow had stayed at all.  But it's a sign of things to come, if the forecast is to be believed.
