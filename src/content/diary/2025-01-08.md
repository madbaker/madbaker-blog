Off to Cedar Hill Rec Centre in the morning, to check on my pottery and meet up with the stamp folks.  It was a nice enough day out, dry but grey, with enough of a breeze to keep me on the bus.  The walk along Gosworth was nice though.  A few birds singing and the plants were extremely green from all the rain.  This is officially 'Oaklands' neighbourhood, I believe, and there are some very nice houses and gardens here.  Normal sized, for normal people.  Not as big and fancy as Fairfield, not as broken down and subversive as Fernwood.  Just right.

In the afternoon, I got my act together and made a supper list for the rest of the week, then walked off to Thrifty Foods to get supplies.  No new blooms in James Bay, but lots and lots of buds.  

I saw a news report that climate change has made it so that southern half of the island rarely gets freezing temperatures any more.  Not even up in Nanaimo, where folks used to go skating outdoors.   I believe it.  We still might get a dump of snow at some point this winter, but nighttime temperatures aren't even dipping below +3C.  Highs of 6-7, lows of 4-5.  That's winter in Victoria.  Meanwhile it's -25C in Prince Albert and blizzards are rocking the middle of the USA.  Wild times.
