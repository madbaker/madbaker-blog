Holiday Monday today as Cindy and Robyn sat down to work up an itinerary for the week.  It's mainly beaches and outdoor markets so there will be lots of Vitamin D in my system this week.  Today was a night market at Gorge Park and then a Harbourcats baseball game in the evening, with fireworks following the game so we hung around the apartment and played cards during the afternoon and set off for the Gorge around 3:30pm.

The park is lovely. The new Japanese inspired pavilion is stunning and the Japanese Garden is a real treat.  Lots of water features and delicate trees.  Because it's a relatively new garden the larger plantings are still slight and tender which is in contrast to the mature trees that we're used to seeing here. And the pathway along the Gorge was full of people out walking and enjoying the late afternoon heat.

The market was a bit of a dud, however, so we walked through quickly and set off for Royal Athletic Park for a shady spot in the bleachers. We enjoyed all the stereotypical things:  hot dogs, beaver tails, goofy mascots and silly contests between innings.  Even a bit of baseball thrown in for good measure.  It was fun but definitely a once a year thing for me.
