The herons are back!  The herons are back!  I saw them flying before I got to the nesting site, the spotted at least six or seven birds up in the nests.  As usual, they are far too high for a good photo, but I enjoyed them nonetheless.

March is here and we're fully into spring.  So many trees in bloom.  Potted daffodils are blooming and the in-ground flowers won't be much longer.  Double digit temperatures, light jackets and an extra spring in my step.

I did the loop through Beacon Hill and Cook Street in the morning, then Cindy and I walked up to North Park and Fernwood in the afternoon.  By the time we turned for home, it had cooled off some, but it was clear this was the end of a warm day.  Reason to smile -- the gloom is beginning to lift.
