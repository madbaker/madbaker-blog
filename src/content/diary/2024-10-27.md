We timed our bike ride well yesterday, because today was cloudy and cooler.  We stuck around home for the most part, getting ready for the week ahead.  

It's easier and easier to see the Inner Harbour from our balcony, as the big oak loses its leaves.  I'd say its 50/50 right now.  Still lots of red to admire, but easier to spot the black squirrels making nests in the branches and the Seattle Clipper in port off in the distance.
