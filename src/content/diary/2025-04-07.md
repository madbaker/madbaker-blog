Another cool and blustery day, although I got outside to run errands before the big raindrops started falling.  It was a quick run to Thrifty Foods and back.  I'm glad I made the walk because I was starting to fear the spring blossoms were done, but I forgot about the final wave, which has just begun along Menzies street.  These are the trees with big clusters of pink flowers, like pompoms.  A little more pushy and garish than the delicate cherry blossoms, but I love them just as much.  The city will be in bloom once more, for another week at least.
