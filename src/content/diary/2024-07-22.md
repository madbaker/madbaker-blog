Lots of work in the morning and a frustrating afternoon meant my only walk was a swift hike to the grocery store for supper supplies.  It's so windy today that my largest tomato pot blew right over, so I scrambled about trying to secure the pot against future gusts.

All I can offer up regarding the soothing effects of nature are the leaves across the top of the oak tree beside my writing chair, glowing gold as the sun sets beyond the tree.  In the foreground, a tomato leaning at 20 degrees to the perpendicular, supported as best as possible by a wire cage and two cedar stakes.  And in front of the tomato, two pots of wind-battered cosmos, which were gorgeous yesterday and now I fear will have no blooms by the morning.  

Ugh. At least the heat wave has passed.
