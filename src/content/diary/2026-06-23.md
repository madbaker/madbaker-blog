The weather is warming up slightly.  I went over to the lawn bowls in the morning to practice a bit, then headed downtown looking for shoes and clothes to wear to a funeral on Friday.  My meager wardrobe is ill-fitting, often threadbare and too casual for a formal gathering.  I gave it an honest go but came home empty-handed and filled with anxiety.  

I relaxed in the afternoon by taking stock of the balcony garden.  Cutworms are still attacking the lettuce, one tomato is all legs,  but the peas are looking good and the few carrots that germinated are healthy.  The cosmos is interesting in that half the plants are huge and robust and the other half, often in the same pot, are small, spindly, and look ready to go dormant.  I'm not sure what I did differently in transplanting, but I am keeping to my deadheading practice going and will see if the smaller plants catch up over summer.
