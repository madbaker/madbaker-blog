The wind has died down a bit but the rain is back, so we stuck around home for the most part, drinking tea, baking bread and working on a jigsaw puzzle.  

We had one brief adventure, when we dashed off to the bus out to Mayfair Mall for some specialty shopping.  It was uniformly awful.  I made two full laps of the place, getting my head stuffed so full of perfumes that I had a headache all afternoon, then we ran for the bus back home.  I'm so glad we only have to go once per year.  

I can't believe how much of a thrill the mall was back in my teens.  People change, I guess.
