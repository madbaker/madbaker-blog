Much soccer today.  Euro final at noon, Copa America at 6pm.  But I forced myself out to Beacon Hill Park between matches to walk on some grass, see some birds and watch some cricket. 

I wandered too close to the heron nests and was nearly hit by a stream of high nitrogen deposits, but leapt to my left after the initial splat and escaped unscathed.  I was caught off guard because I couldn't hear them up in the trees for once, and I assumed they were all off feeding.  

The rose garden was a mass of colour.  This must be prime rose season.  I love roses but I think they were causing the majority of my spring allergies earlier in the year, so I kept a respectful distance.

And then I sat down at the cricket pitch and enjoyed the second half of the game.  Chasing 126 over 40 overs, I alternated between a sunny bench (very hot) and a shady bench (quite chilly) till the batters got to 102-2 in 20 overs, then headed home.  I think they had the remaining runs covered easily enough.

My mind has been cluttered the past few days, and I've lost sight of the purpose of my walks.  That is, to notice nature in all its forms, wherever I go walking.  Will stroll with more intention next week.
