I stayed in today.  The after-effects of my flu shot took the entire day to wear off.  It wasn't anything too major, I was just extremely tired all day.  My only outing was a trip across the street to the Glensheil, to pick up a stamp collection donation from a retiring collector.

If there was good news, it was a cool and very wet day, so I didn't miss much.  Although I've watched several reels extolling the virtues of embracing all weather, so I need to change my language about the rain.
