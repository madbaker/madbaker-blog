Flew home today.  We were supposed to arrive at 3PM but with the flight cancellations, spent 5 hours in Vancouver and arrived home just after midnight.  So I truly have nothing to report today.

Well, just that the sight of mountains, then trees, then ocean raised my spirits at every step.  And deeply inhaling the cool, damp air as we stepped out of the airport was the best refreshment I could hope for.

There's a sight when the airport doors first open -- cedar beams overhead, a totem pole, a huge flower bed, tree covered mountains in the distance -- that thrills me every time I see it.  And now that view says 'home' to me and I love it.
