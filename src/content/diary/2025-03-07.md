Argh.  Too much working and not enough walking. Or to be fair, not enough writing.  It's taken me until mid-afternoon to get outside every day, but I have made it out for a walk at least.

The weather has been mild and quite sunny, so I got out for two long walks along Dallas Road and Cook Street.  The spring flowers are growing taller, more early blossoms on the trees and even some of the later trees are beginning to bud.

I've been focused on birds lately, thanks to the Merlin App.  I'm trying to isolate birdsong and then use the app to identify the bird.  It works extremely well and I'm training my ear to hear more birds and identify the birds I hear.  The finches outside my window are quite noticeable as finches now.
