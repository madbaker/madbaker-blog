It was our laundry day and looked like rain outside, so we just about stayed in for the day.  But at the last minute, we took off to the Conservatory of Music for a special concert for Truth and Reconciliation Day.  

The music was stellar. Everything from traditional Indigenous dances to hip hop to pop and even opera.  Plus, an Elder and residential school survivor spoke quietly but strongly about his experiences as a child and the trauma that still affects him.  

We are so much richer when we embrace the culture and traditions of all people, and especially our Indigenous relatives.  The more I learn and experience, the more I feel like I actually understand where I am from.

After the concert, we walked along Government Street, back among the tourists and locals who think of Victoria as 'Little Britain', when this place is so much more.
