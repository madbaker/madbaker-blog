Today we had the bright sunshine I hoped for yesterday when Chris and Amy were here.  That's OK, I enjoyed it all the same.  I skipped out of the house early and went through James Bay on some errands and then downtown for a few more errands, sticking to the sunny side of the street as much as possible.

I made a special side trip down Clarence Street to check out the bookboxes and admire the local handiwork.  The local homeowners have festooned the boulevard trees with Christmas baubles along the entire block.  I thought this was the teacup street (where the trees have cups and saucers hanging from the branches) but I'm either off by a block or they switch to baubles for the Holidays.  I'll keep you posted.

By afternoon, the clouds rolled in and the temperature dropped noticeably, so I'm glad I went out in the early morning.  Long may the sunny mornings continue.
