It was a long day editing a podcast, but by late afternoon I set out for a walk.  I made a medium loop around James Bay, checking out the book boxes without success, before heading through Beacon Hill Park from the south.

I took a path I rarely use and stumbled across a pea-hen with three little ones.  They were small adolescents, all feeding on the grass.  They were still small enough that the mother was _very_ protective, and walked directly toward me, at pace, when I stopped to snap a picture.  I expressed my gentle intentions but she was having none of it, so I clicked twice, quickly, and moved on my way.

I stopped for two more flower pictures.  My friend Vince says that I should really start collecting flowers on stamps since I admire gardens so much.  Maybe I will!
