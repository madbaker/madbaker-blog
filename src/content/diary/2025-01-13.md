I spent the morning prepping for a call after lunch, then took the call, hung up and ran off to the bus for my weekly pottery class.  I slowed my heart rate down on the walk to the rec centre.  It was a nice enough day -- slightly cloudy but no real chance of rain during the day -- so I listened for songbirds and watched a grey squirrel follow a black squirrel along the top of a fence.  

It's still dark well before 5:30PM when the class ended, so I walked to the bus as safely as I could. It was more important that drivers saw me than I saw any nighttime wildlife.
