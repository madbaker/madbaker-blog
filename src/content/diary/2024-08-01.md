Calls in the morning and then an extra long Zoom with the board of the stamp club after lunch meant that we didn't get out for a walk until after 3pm.  We were hoping to hike to Hillside Mall for some supplies but that was a big mistake.  The weather has hotted up again and we wilted before we got out of downtown.

As we felt our brains soften and ooze out of our ears, we made the smart decision to abandon our plan and head over to Cook Street to pick up some apples at Root Cellar and look for some sale meat.  Then we staggered home, set up the fans and sat in the dark for a few hours.

It's distressing to see so many small businesses on Cook Street closing down.  Hot and Cold cafe is done.  The organic market is closed, though I assume when the much larger Root Cellar opened across the street, their days were numbered.

And yet, we saw a sign for a new bread bakery opening on Menzies Street yesterday.  So folks are still trying.  With rents and food costs through the roof, I don't know how anyone makes a go of it anymore.  Broughton Street deli wants $21 for a smoked meat sandwich.  I want to spend $21 per day on groceries for both of us.  That's a pretty big gap.
