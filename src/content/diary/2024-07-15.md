It was a heavy work day so I didn't really get outside at all.  Watering my garden, wondering if any of the flowers on my tomato will germinate, looking desperately for pollinators.  Can I carry bees up here somehow?  I don't think that's how it works.  I'm starting to give the stink eye to the landscapers down on ground level.  I suspect they are spraying noxious chemicals even though their trucks are all labelled 'green' and 'natural'.  Maybe that's why the manure mulch smells so bad out here.  Maybe it's bee repellent.  Ugh.

We did make it out in late afternoon for a grocery run to Fairway Market in Quadra Village for some extremely expensive specialty Asian food.  The walk was fun but it was definitely a city walk.  The only wildlife I noticed was fried chicken.
