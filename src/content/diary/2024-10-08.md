It was cool and rainy all day, so beside walking across the street to mail a letter, I stayed inside all day.  Until, that is, when I joined Cindy for a co-worker's birthday dinner at Tapa Bar.  It was pouring buckets.  One of those rains where your legs get soaked even though you have an umbrella.  So many people trying to brave the elements with only a raincoat and looking miserable.  

Dinner was awesome and the rain stopped before we walked home, so we strolled down Government Street and watched the lights from the Legislature reflecting in the harbour.  It was cold and breezy after a hot restaurant, so we didn't linger, however.
