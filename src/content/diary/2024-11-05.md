I had an early walk today, as I was back baking at Union Pacific.  So I headed out in the dark at 5:25AM for the 20 minute walk to the shop.  It was quite peaceful, other than the City crew out power washing the trash cans along Government Street.  Who knew two people could make that much noise, literally shouting a conversation over the sound of gas engines and power washers.  I kept looking to floors above the ground floor stores, trying to see if people lived up there.

Government Street is lined with pruned, globe shaped trees that never seem to lose their leaves.  I don't know what species they are, but they are real, for sure.  And this time of year, they are packed full of birds.  Whenever the crews took a break, the air was full of birdsong, likely saying 'turn off that damn engine!' in bird-speak.

I got to see the sunrise from the bakers bench, which is always a special feeling and as the morning progressed, it turned into a very nice day.  Nothing like the wind storm from Monday. So I took a long, leisurely walk home, stopping at the library and a couple of shops.  Then went home and fell into my chair.  I guess I'll need to build up my baking stamina over time.
