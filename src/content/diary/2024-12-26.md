Boxing Day.  We avoided the sales and the morning wind and rain, choosing to stay inside and laze about. But after lunch the skies cleared and we headed out for a walk towards Johnson Street bridge.

It was windier and cooler than we expected, so rather than cross over and take the Esquimalt walk, we went through Chinatown.  Part of the problem is that the sun is so low in the sky that we're in shadow most of the time.  

We walked along Store Street, watching the harbour planes land in the nasty cross winds.  They'd approach from the northwest and then bank around 90 degrees to land facing southwest.  The turn was more of a drift, sliding sideways then hanging in place, turning the nose and then descending with a pronounced wobble.  I'd be hurling through the whole maneuver, guaranteed.

We walked home along Blanshard Street and I noticed a lot of squirrels out and about.  Must be warmer close to the ground.  My recurring thought with squirrels is how they are loved but rats are loathed, when most of the difference is squirrels have a bushy tail.  I don't see folks leaving food out for rats (not intentionally anyway) but the squirrels all have a peanut supplier or two.
