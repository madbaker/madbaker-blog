Easter Monday, so Cindy was off work.  The wind gusts have died down so we're able to inspect the bamboo plant in its new home.  I think it's going to work very well indeed.  I planted all the peas, the remaining flowers and my tomato plant and got them into something close to their final resting place on the patio.  Just a bit more cleanup and re-arranging to go.

We were both getting tired, so ended up driving out to Oak Bay for groceries.  The drive gave us an excuse to cruise along Beach Avenue and look at the sailboats at the marina.  It was all built infrastructure, but it certainly sits nicely in the landscape out here.
