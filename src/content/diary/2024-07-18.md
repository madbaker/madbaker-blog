I was up super early today to take the bus to Uptown and see an endodontist.  A 360 degree x-ray later, I booked in for a root canal in September and was back on the bus home.  It was a cool, sunny, peaceful morning, but not much nature except for foundation plantings around the office park.  

In the afternoon, we drove out to Swartz Bay to pick up Ben and Laura from the ferry.  It was a lovely, warm afternoon and I got to spend a good 10 minutes gazing out at the calm sea and tiny islands that surround the bay.  We took the back road home, replacing the bumper to bumper traffic with a gentle cruise through the forest, with intermittent views of Patricia Bay.  A slow drive was as close as I got to stopping to smell the flowers today, but it was still a joy.
