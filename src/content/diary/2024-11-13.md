Off to work in the dark, with a cold wind swirling around me.  It rained overnight, and would rain again before I got to the shop, and my baking shoes are worn and leaky, so I picked my way around the puddles and stayed near the awnings as best I could.  

It's nice to be baking again, because the world looks much more optimistic at sunrise.  The sun rose again, the skies cleared, the shop smelt of coffee and baked goods and folks started coming by, singles and couples and then entire workgroups.  We were buzzing by 10AM.  I walked home with an extra spring in my step, and when I saw the mountains in the distance my spirits rose even further.  Job done for today.  The people have been fed.
