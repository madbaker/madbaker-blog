A meeting at Cedar Hill Rec Centre, followed by a dentist appointment meant that there wasn't much walking for me today.  Although the bus ride in the morning was nice.  It's a splendid autumn day and the 10 minute was to the rec centre was enjoyable.

This new bus route dropped me off west of the building so I got to walk along the edge of the golf course.  Green enough, but an artificial, heavily fertilized green without any golfers to use it. Ah well.
