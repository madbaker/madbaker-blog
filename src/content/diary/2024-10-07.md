Back to work, with calls in the morning and errands in the afternoon.  I did a quick walk to the post office, and home along the harbour, but that was about it.  

It was another lovely fall day, but by 4pm it was clouding over and got chilly right quick.  1pm is peak outdoor time in October.  I need to start booking that in my calendar.  

It was an all-garden supper, featuring peppers, tomatoes and lettuce from the balcony.  I can't get enough of it.  And the winter broccoli seems to have survived the trials of transplanting.  Now I need to find a space for winter garlic.
