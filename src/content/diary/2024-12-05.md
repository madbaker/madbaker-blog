It may have taken me a month, but I finally made it out for a pleasurable walk today, with no errands or odd jobs included.  The sun was doing its best to burst through the high clouds as I set off through James Bay towards Dallas Road.  Ocean!  I saw ocean!  I may live five blocks from the sea but it's been ages since I've seen it.  

I wandered slowly along Dallas Road, watching the birds and boats.  I saw a hummingbird for a fleeting moment along the same stretch of bushes I've seen it several times.  I know where a hummingbird hangs out! That's pretty cool.

I haven't lived here long enough to get used to all the plant growth in December.  I saw bushes budding out, delicate wildflowers and some absolutely huge mushrooms.  

I needed this walk in the worst way.  Time to recreate a habit.
