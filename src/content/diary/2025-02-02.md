Typical Sunday, getting the chores done to kick off a new week.  But by the afternoon, we were feeling frisky so got a car and drove out to UVic for a matinee movie (Bookworms, highly recommended) and then a stop for groceries.  It was proper snowing by the drive home.  Full on use your wipers and hit the rear defrost for the window and heated seat for my butt.  

The snow is starting to accumulate some, but what we're noticing so far is that most of the snow doesn't stay and the snowfall is interspersed with some window-rattling winds.  Weird weather.

Cin is starting to worry about the balcony plants but I think they are strong enough to handle this cold.  It's only -1C and there's no snow on the balcony yet.
