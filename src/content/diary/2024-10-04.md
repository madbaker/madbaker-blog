Big rain in the morning, but by noon the sun was out so I set out to Phillips for our weekend beverages.  Before long the sun was fully out and it was quite warm, but as soon as any shade appeared my jacket went on right quick.

There wasn't much for wildlife on this walk.  The trees continue to turn colour and the Empress has managed to capture the last bit of summer in its flower beds.  IT won't be long before they are dug up and replanted, so I will enjoy the final weeks of the summer blooms.

Of note:  The 'Air Lobby', an airBnb bag storage business, is now closed.  They have a banner reading "closed due to NDP decree" taped in the window.  Good riddance, you parasites.  The best thing the government did was make it too expensive to hoard all the apartments for tourists over the needs of citizens.
