I woke up to birdsong from the Big Oak, which was delightful.  Only one bird, who I believe is a House Finch.  I couldn't get a good look but I recorded the song and checked it against the excellent Merlin app and it's a pretty good match.

I gave myself a kick in the pants and got out for a proper walk this morning, over to Cook Street, along Dallas Road and back through Beacon Hill Park.  There were so many birds out, especially since I was listening for them, so I put Merlin through its paces.   It's excellent.  I added eight birds to my 'life list', including the bald eagle I watched land on top of the totem pole!  I shared the moment with a lady who was on the other side of the pole.  We spoke for a bit and agreed that it was a special moment indeed.  

Bulbs are poking up all through Beacon Hill.  It won't be long before the park is full of colour again.
