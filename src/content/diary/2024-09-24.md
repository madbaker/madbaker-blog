Ugh. Another day indoors.  Drizzle for much of the day and I was loaded up with Zoom calls.  I'm having a ton of podcast conversations these days, to get me through the end of the year with regular episodes.  Each conversation is great but it's exhausting.  I'm more private than this.

I did rush out to the drug store in the afternoon for a few supplies.  It was much warmer than I expected.  Cloudly days leaves the apartment quite cool, but it's not winter yet.  I need to remember that, and remember that I need to see the ocean on a regular basis.
