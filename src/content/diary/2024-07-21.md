We returned Ben to the ferry terminal in the morning but it was a quick drive.  I was sad enough saying farewell that I don't remember a thing about the views or even the weather.  But in the evening, I took a long walk through James Bay, looking for new summer flowers.

I found some lovely Dahlias, a bundle of tall sweet peas, and two plants I needed the app to identify.  A tall perennial with drooping white flowers turned out to be Adam's Needle, or _Yucca Filamentosa_, while a low, deep orange flower bordering the community garden is simply Garden Nasturtium.  I've seen nasturtiums before, but the low sun angle made these shine more brilliantly than any others.
