Day off today but with a call at 11AM.  It's funny how a couple of early mornings working at UP and an 11AM call seems mid-day.  I kept myself busy waiting for 11 to arrive.  

I saw another hummingbird on the balcony which always raises my spirits. Is it the same bird?  I can't tell, it's too small and fleeting.

It's chilly and cloudy out, very much 'carry an umbrella' weather.  I went for a short walk but nothing remarkable.  I'm falling out of practice with daily outdoor adventures and it shows in these notes.
