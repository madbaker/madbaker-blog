We went out for a proper in the late morning, out to Working Culture for treats and a limited edition (and very expensive) Zine.  The trees around the Empress Hotel are in full bloom and the taller stone beds are in full bloom too.  The tulips in the main beds are still warming up but it won't be long for them either.

We walked home along Wharf Street and I was struck again, for the thousandth time at least, at just how beautiful it is along Inner Harbour.  Yes, there are too many cars, too much asphalt, but the indentations of the harbour, the green grass of Potter Point, the mountains in the distance, all combine into a stunning scene in the middle / far distance.  It's lovely and I hope I never get tired of this view.
