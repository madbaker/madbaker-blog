Another crisp, sunny morning.  It's been quite a run!  I tried to head out early enough to walk to Cedar Hill, but ended up on the bus as usual.  My stroll down Gosworth happened just as the sun crested the houses to my right, turning the left side of the street to shimmering gold.  The frost on the grass was smoking as it burned off where the sun hit it. 

I walked all the way home, which was brilliant, but never as good at noon as right at 8:30, when the sun is breaking through.  I class these as sunny days, but there is the thinnest layer of cloud, just enough to dull ol' Sol's intensity at high noon, which still isn't very high.
