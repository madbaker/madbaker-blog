I got my work done in the morning and headed out for a nice walk after lunch.  Another sunny day but much cooler, not much above 12C, so there was a bite to the breeze.  But I did the loop around James Bay and Dallas Road before coming home down Government Street.  

The highlight was near the Emily Carr house, where we were stopped by a large stag crossing the road.  He looked to be about 3-4 years old at least and appeared well fed by all the neighbourhood flowers.  Strong back quarter and a smooth, clear coat.

I chuckled when I thought that the deer have it so good here; they get to check out the back yards of all the character homes while us humans are stuck on the front sidewalk, trying to peek over the gate.
