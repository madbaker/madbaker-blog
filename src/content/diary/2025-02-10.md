The sun is finally starting to appear after a week of snow and then cloud.  All the snow is gone, so the green grass is leaning into the sunshine again.  Still got a very brisk wind, however.

I set off in the morning to James Bay for groceries, then rushed off to the bus in the afternoon for my pottery class.  The walk from the bus to the rec centre was the highlight -- a warm, sunny sidewalk, plenty of birdsong (though the birds were in hiding) and the wind at my back.  

I had a meeting downtown right after class so I barely had time to look around before leaping back on the bus.  But I did catch a light purple pink sky as the sun was setting, and a V of Canada Geese honking away overhead, which was exceptionally lovely.  But I was on the bus within a minute and couldn't really revel in the sights and sounds.  Ah well, we do our best.
