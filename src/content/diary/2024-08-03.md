Lovely warm summer day today, but I slept in so Cindy had to give me a kick to get to the seedling distribution day in James Bay.  This is one of two days per year when the City hands out vegetable seedlings to local gardeners, in an attempt to get more folks gardening and a tiny bit more food resilient.

I confused this with the plant exchange day, where gardeners divide their plants and trade them around.  I'm not as big of a fan of the plant exchanges, so was delighted to be mistaken.  I picked up four super healthy snap peas, four tiny winter lettuces, and a spring sprouting broccoli.  I'm getting them all into their permanent containers this weekend, to see how much over wintering I can accomplish this year.  I'm very excited.

The afternoon was spent indoors, preparing the apartment for Robyn's arrival but it was one of those days that an early evening drive for groceries and to the airport was a delight.  Warm sun, calm winds and stunning views of Mt. Baker as we approached the airport.  Even groceries highlighted summer - local strawberries and the first sweet corn of the season are now in our kitchen.
