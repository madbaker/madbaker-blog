Ugh.  Can I admit that I'm not in the mood for a walk? I went anyway, through Beacon Hill Park under grey cloud.  I went in the early afternoon and met an elementary school class at the entrance to the park.  They were loud enough to scare away anything other than ducks and seagulls, but it's good that they get to frolic outside, so I passed them by before getting into my rhythm.

I'm cranky about things that are out of my control, so found it difficult to focus on the nature around me.  Even the peacocks seemed blander than normal.  Instead of praising the fact that flowers are breaking through ground, I was mad that they weren't further along.  Much more of a reflection on myself, not the plants.  They are doing what they need to do to take care of themselves.  I could learn from them.
