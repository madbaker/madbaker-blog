The flu shot I got yesterday didn't kick in until the afternoon, so I took advantage of the sunny morning and got outside for a walk.  I wandered around James Bay, checking out book boxes and kicking fallen chestnuts along the sidewalk.  I've never played a competitive game of football, but every time I see a chestnut, acorn, pine cone or rock, I briefly turn into Dennis Bergkamp.

It was one of those walks where I saw nothing remarkable, but in its totality, it was refreshing and built up my spirits.  A walk where I left my earbuds in my pocket and took in the sounds of my surroundings.  The odd sparrow, a car passing, folks out walking their dogs.  I got lost in the walk and my own thoughts until I was directly beside the Coho ferry on Belleville when it honked to announce its departure.  The horn made me jump and brought me back to the present, and the realization that I was getting quite tired, so I set off for home.  My 24 hours of flu shot fun was taking hold.
