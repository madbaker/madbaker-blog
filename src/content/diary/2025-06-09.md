Today's the last day of the heat wave according to the forecast anyway, so I went over to the bowling green early for a practice session.  Had a fun time with Al and Verilie.  The gardens around the green are gorgeous, and the roses are all starting to flower.  Some folks are there for the bowling but there are some dedicated souls who are only there for the gardening.  I appreciate them.

From bowling, I walked over to Root Cellar for some groceries and passed some very attractive peonies.  I think they're called 'double blooms' -- pink petals surrounding a large, ruffled, white middle.  Very attractive.  

Between the peonies and the roses in bloom, June is the month for big, bold flowers.
