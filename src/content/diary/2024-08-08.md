Out the door early to go to Jam for Brunch #2 of Robyn's vacation.  We got seated right away and had a great meal as usual.  There's an especially good feeling about having a great meal at a popular place and getting seated right away and seeing a huge line as you leave to go home.  I chalk it up to local knowledge and anticipating when the first table turnover is going to happen.

Then the rest of the day was spent on Zoom until, in the late afternoon, we drove up to Sidney for their night market.  We arrived two hours early to pop in at [Sm√∏r](https://smor.ca) and see how Leah was doing two weeks after opening, and then sat on the huge green lawn by the pier and watched the boats sail past and see if the seagulls were having any success pilfering snacks from absent-minded lawn loungers.

The market was bustling.  And hot.  Especially hot as you walked west into the evening sun.  We scurried up the market into the sun and then turned and slowly strolled back down with the sun at our backs.  The vendors on the way back did better business from us, but overall we were frugal.  A big head of lettuce and a small piece of cheese.  Robyn couldn't resist the beef jerky samples so we have beef jerky too.  Fun and boisterous and we were grateful for the air conditioning on the drive home.
