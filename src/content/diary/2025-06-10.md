The heat is holding on for one more day.  In the morning, I went to the bank for some haircut money and to the library to pick up a hold.  Then I wandered past the bowling green and was invited to make up the numbers for the women's session.  It was fun, although I didn't bowl all that well.  The highlight was listening to the drumming and singing drifting over from the Big House, where they were holding a large welcome ceremony for Land Guardians. 

The bowling must have been fun, because after lunch I went back for a mixed game.  The sun was out in force and it was very warm on the green. I really need to get a wide brimmed hat or my neck is going to burn.

Before the games start, I like to walk around the flower garden to see if I can spot something new.  I saw something that I think are alliums, but have tight, smooth, shiny bulbs at the top of long spikes.  My app says they are wild garlic.  Beautiful.
