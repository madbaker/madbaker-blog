_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

It's a stonking hot day, 34C at least, but we spent all of it indoors, having coffee with Sharron, Shannon and Eleanor in an air conditioned coffee shop.  And after a four hour coffee chat, we drove to Milky Way for ice cream and nearly passed out in line from the heat.  It's a warm one, yes it is.

In the evening we went to visit Cin's dad and took him out to an inner courtyard at the home.  There was a nice shade tree to sit him under and lots and lots of container plants.  Flowers, tomatoes, even a cucumber.  Most had been neglected for a while and were very stressed, so I found a hose and watering can and gave everything a good soak.  Hopefully it spruces up a few of them, although many are too far gone.
