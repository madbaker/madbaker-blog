It was a working and house cleaning day today, but I made it out for a walk in the late afternoon.  I hiked up to North Park for a walk through the WIN craft store, but when I arrived they were closing an hour early.  The single volunteer had another commitment.  I was frustrated, because I got there early to have a proper look, but had calmed down by the time I was halfway home.  That stuff happens and we all have lives to live.  

It sure was frustrating though.  It was a very warm, sunny day and the walk to North Park was loud and dusty and frantic.  And extremely windy.  The wind kept increasing on the walk home and soon was a gale.  The wind blew clouds in from the west and within two hours our hot sunny day turned into a cold, blustery rain shower.

Ben came over on the ferry for the weekend and when we went to pick him up at 8:30pm it was still raining.  You'd think we were in an all day winter soaker; solid cloud cover, steady rain coming down and torrents of spray coming up from the passing cars.  But then by the time we reached Michel's farm, the sun ducked under the clouds and cast a huge rainbow east across the gulf islands.  I only caught a glimpse (had to focus on the road) but Cindy confirmed its beauty and said there was a hint of a double rainbow too.
