Cool with a hint of rain as I set out to Union Pacific for a meetup with Kelley and Lindsay.  They asked if I would cover some opening shifts so UP could stay open as they took their annual southern vacation.  I think it's going to happen.  

It was a nice walk through downtown.  Still tourists about, but not the masses of cruise ship traffic.  There's a nice vibe to the place these days.  

With more gloomy weather in the forecast and colder temps, the summer displays at the Empress look prime for replacing.  They'd last another two months in my garden but the Empress needs to appear 'peak' at all times. I wonder if I should ask for some of the plants to bring home.
