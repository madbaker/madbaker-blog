The cloud and cooler temps were back today.  Or maybe I was gloomy because I had an early dentist appointment.  Tough to say on the way there, but after I got a $4500 quote to replace a tooth that is 'beyond repair', I was in full gloom mode and I can't blame the weather.  

I tried my best to enjoy the new flower beds at the Empress Hotel, and gaze jealously at the massive pile of compost that was dumped there, ready for spreading, but my mood overtook me, and I went home to sulk for the rest of the day.  I was a little better by evening, but not much.
