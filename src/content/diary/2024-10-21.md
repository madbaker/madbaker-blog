The Atmospheric River has flowed away, for now.  Video from Vancouver shows some severe flash flooding, but here was only three solid days of rain.  But the skies are slowly clearing and by afternoon, there was sun again.

I took a slightly roundabout route to the grocery store, but that was it for my walking today.  It was chillier than I expected.  The sun was shining but it wasn't packing much heat yet.

In other news, I gave the garden a good water (I know!  All that rain but nothing came under the balcony overhang) and noticed one spring brocolli plant has lots of new growth.  It seems to be thriving in the planter bed.  The second plant is slower going, still recovering from the worm damage a few weeks back.

I picked the last of the peppers and brought them inside.  And the once-mighty Cosmos is all pulled up.  That leaves lettuce and carrots to eat along with gazanias, marigolds and African daisies to look at.  Stunning for this time of year.
