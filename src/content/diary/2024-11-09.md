Today, we have a mission.  Cindy needs a new bike light.  So we started out towards downtown and Fort Cycle, before heading back toward the ocean and Fairfield Cycle. The purchase was always going to be made at Fairfield Cycle, the friendliest, most common-sense bike shop in town, but we wanted to give some of the others a chance too. 

It was a grey day, but calm and almost warm.  Perfect for strolling about, gazing at the tall cedars, admiring front gardens and big, elegant homes and being grateful that we don't have to maintain any of it.  The moss growing between roof shingles glows brightly this time of year.

The ocean was calm, blue grey and full of boats.  Big container ships heading for port, smaller fishing boats and even a few sail boats gliding slowly past.  It was brilliant.  

It may be chilly and grey these days, but there is always a pocket of brilliant colour on every block.  The big leaves have fallen but the smaller trees are coming into their moment.  And the grass is as green as can be.
