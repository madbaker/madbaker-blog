Actual rain today, but I had an appointment so found my waterproof shoes and headed out to Saanich for two hours in the dentist's chair.  I don't mind the rain, my new jacket can handle the light stuff quite well without getting all sweated up.  

As if to remind me that running errands doesn't really count as communing with nature, two of my peacock relatives were waiting for me at the door to the building.  I promised to visit soon, before running to the bus.
