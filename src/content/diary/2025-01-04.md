This is the longest patch of sustained raininess we've had in several years.  I got outside during a period of light drizzle, long enough to pick up a few supplies for a still ailing Cindy.  Just me and a few hardy souls, a clip-clopping Clydesdale that had no say in the matter, and several small songbirds high up in the trees.  It was a joy to listen to the natural sounds given the lack of mechanical sounds to drown them out.

I'm lucky though.  There are so many electric cars here that car noise is quite low overall.  So many EV's that roar of so-called 'classic' cars and motorcycles, not to mention the double decker buses and all the sirens, is quite disturbing.
