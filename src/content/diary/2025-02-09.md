Gee whiz, the wind is still mighty chilly.  Today was the winter stamp show, so my walk was a bit of a dull one, nature wise -- straight up Douglas Street to the Sandman Inn.  I know I talk about urban nature a lot but I find it hard to be optimistic about Douglas Street.  It's the grubbiest street in town, with the most traffic and most boarded up shops.  The street we avoid walking down as much as possible.  But that was my destination today and I made the best of it.
