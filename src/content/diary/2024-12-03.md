I was determined to have a better day today, so I set out in the morning for the library to pick up a hold, then walked back along the harbour and into James Bay.  The sun was mostly out and there was hope in the air, for sure.  I noticed the Welcome to Victoria flower beds are all prepped and ready for replanting, so will keep a close eye on what gets placed there, and when they are planted.  

By the time I got to Thrifty Foods, the sun was fully out and folks knew all about it.  Every chair, bench and ledge had someone sitting on it, facing due south, soaking up as many rays as possible.  I found a piece of ledge myself and recharged before meandering home.

Squirrels, Sparrows and dogs were the order of the day today.  I must get to Beacon Hill Park soon, or even to the ocean, to expand my nature horizons.
