We have a visitor!  This afternoon, a tiny bird came by the balcony and spent a solid hour checking out the daffodil pot.  She was on the ledge of the pot, down in the dirt, shuffling all over.  I hope she's building a nest in there.  That would be awesome.

I did some searching and determined she's a female ruby-crowned kinglet.  Beautiful.
