Back to work for both of us, but I managed to walk over to Thrifty's for groceries around noon.  Lots of people out and even more flowers in bloom.  If you're a tulip in a pot, you've likely bloomed by now.  If you're a tulip in the ground, you're just about to burst open.  Life, warm sunshine and blue skies everywhere.  Until 3pm, that is, when a dark cloud rolled through and dumped buckets of rain for five minutes and then moved on.

After the shower, I bussed to Uptown for some quick shopping.  The cherry trees in the pedestrian mall were in full flower, sheltered from the wind, and were a thick blanket of pink-tinged white.  I hate that these lovely trees are surrounded by concrete, but they are remarkable nonetheless.
