Cindy's birthday today, so we had a day of great adventures.  First, we walked out to Moss Street for the Holiday Market.  It was crowded, boisterous and lovely.  We bought all kinds of treats from Josh's stand and then walked home to eat them all up.

It was a cool, drizzly day that was always threatening proper rain but it never really materialized.  One of those days where you carry an umbrella but wear a toque.

After lunch we bussed up to UVic for a movie. Lots and lots of deer all through Uplands.  This is how you know the neighbourhood is posh -- sweeping lawns, and more deer than people.  Everywhere else in Victoria there are people out walking about, but never in Uplands.  We drive here, _dahling_.  

At Cinecenta, we watched an animated feature _Memoir of a Snail_ which was brilliant.  It's an Australian film, extremely moving and drop-dead hilarious in spots.  A film that burrows deep into your brain and triggers all sorts of sad-funny childhood memories.  At least for me.

We went to the matinee, so left the theatre at 4:45PM in the pitch dark and pouring rain.  Finally, our umbrellas came in handy as we ran to the bus.
