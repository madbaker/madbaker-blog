Cool, cloudy day outside and inside.  Cin was diagnosed with pneumonia which needed a doctor and xray to determine, so I focused on errands and making sure the house was well stocked.  Several false turns, as my order at Opus hadn't actually arrived (it seems to take 5 days to get here from Burnaby), Cin's antibiotics took longer than expected, no holds at the library, and so on.
