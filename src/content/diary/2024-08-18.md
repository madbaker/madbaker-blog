_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

It's not as smoky today and is really hotting up.  We said our goodbyes to Dad in the morning then headed back to Regina for a few days at Cindy's mom's house.  The land of central air conditioning and a menagerie of cats and dogs.

We spent the afternoon alternating between sitting outside and sitting inside.  Hot then cold, then repeat.  

The animals are very glad to see us.  The dogs are especially excited so I have to be alert at all time lest Tucker crush my spine in his exuberance.  He's built like a tank, short, stocky and powerful.

I've come to accept that we won't be walking much.  Neither will we eat many vegetables.  It's the way of the west (but not the coast.)
