Christmas Day.  It rained all day, but that's OK.  Our day was full of Zoom calls with family, reading the books I found in my stocking, and starting to make a dent in the food we've been stockpiling.

Based on the Zoom calls, Saskatchewan was the place to be today.  A white Christmas with mild temps and clear, blue skies.  Good for them.
