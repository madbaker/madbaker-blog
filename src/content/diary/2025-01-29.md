I went to bed with the best of intentions, but my goodness I sleep well on Wednesday mornings.  I woke with a start, showered quick and ran off to catch the bus to Cedar Hill.  My desire to walk out and back will have to wait another week.

It was the right decision, because after weeks of sunshine, this morning was cloudy and extra frosty.  As the temperatures rose and I walked the final few blocks to the Rec Centre, the frost began melting off the overhead power lines and dripping on my head and then onto the sidewalk after I adjusted my line.  But it was still cold. Those drips froze on the sidewalk, forming tiny, clear, extra slippery ice humps.  I only skidded out once, but it was enough.

It was still cloudy after the meetup, as I walked over to Mayfair Mall and did a loop through the Staples.  Then I caught the bus back downtown.  It was 2:30PM when I walked into the apartment;  I know that because the sun was shining fully on the clock, illuminating the time.  The skies had completely cleared in time for a bit of sun in the living room before sunset.  Not the best timing but there you go.

The forecast is for more cloud, and rain, and possibly even snow.  I can't wait!
