Today was errands and groceries day, but I got two walks in regardless.  The first was a loop out to Save On Foods and Bulk Barn.  Pure city walking.  The Save On is right beside the tent encampment on Pandora Avenue so it's always a sad walk.  All that strife in the shadow of new condo towers is too much inequity for me.  We walked in silence and slowly building frustration at the powers-that-be and those who enable them, bought our food and walked home.

The afternoon brought another walk, this time to Root Cellar on Cook for sale meat and fresh corn.  I stopped for a moment to watch a football game in the park, and admired my favourite condo flower garden on Southgate before heading back home.  Only birdsong and squirrels in terms of wildlife today.

On the way home I noticed a man in a jersey carrying a case of beer towards the cricket oval.  I must remember to go watch some cricket next Sunday.

My balcony garden is still going strong. I moved my lettuce starts to their final home, and pruned the bushiest tomato to get a few more sun rays on the green fruit.  If I squint, I can see a hint of orange on some of the tomatoes, but I have to squeeze my eyes so tightly my head hurts.
