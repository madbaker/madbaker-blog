Today's rain was forecast for the afternoon, so I ran out in the morning for a few more supper essentials while it was dry.  I just about made it too.  By 11AM we got into rain, sun, dark clouds, some wind, more rain, and on and on.  After sunset, it was just wind and rain, rattling our balcony windows and throwing empty watering cans all about.  

The plants seem to have survived well enough.  It's entirely likely that the daffodils will bloom on the day it snows.  The flower pods are getting paler and, dare I say it, yellower.  I doubt we'll get any actual accumulation on the balcony -- there are too many overhangs -- so bring it on, I say. 

And thus ends January.  Overall, a surprisingly sunny month.  It felt like spring was on our doorstep for most of it, but the past two days is a reminder that we're still in the middle of winter. I'm excited to see what February brings.
