I was out the door early to catch a bus up to Sidney for a doctor's appointment.  An hour on the bus for a three minute procedure.  It wasn't even 10AM so I went to visit Leah and wander around town before heading for the bus stop home.

It was a cool, sunny day but with plenty of cloud cover in the distance, so there were now views of Mount Baker.  That is always the highlight, and often the point, of heading up the Saanich peninsula.  Ah well.  I got to take a good look at the vegetable farms as we drove past.  They must have had some cool nights in the valleys because the outer rows of pumpkins were all flattened.  The leaves, I mean.  All that was left were bright orange squashes sitting proudly, surrounded by dark green mush.

Just before reaching Sidney I was treated to a huge eagle soaring above the trees, making a single long, slow arc in the sky.  The wingspan was immense.  Sadly, we drove on before I could see if it saw anything worth swooping down to catch.

In the evening, the clouds moved in and it was raining steadily, so I took a car to the stamp club meeting.  It was only 6:45PM but it was proper twilight.  Nothing feels like fall is coming here like rain and early darkness.  I feel the season changing quite acutely.
