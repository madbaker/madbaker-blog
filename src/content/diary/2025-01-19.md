The mornings are ever so slightly brighter each day, so I'm now able to watch the sunrise from my chair, with a fresh mug of coffee in my hand.  It's glorious. 

Today dawned crisp and sunny once again, but we had our usual weekend indoor work to do, so I didn't get out until after lunch.  I made a loop over to Root Cellar looking for sale chicken and ending up with sale blueberries.  The soccer field was full of folks enjoying the sun, playing volleyball while wearing toques, kicking the soccer ball around, chucking balls for dogs to chase, and so on.  It was lovely.  I have to keep reminding myself it's January.  Feels like April today, even at +5C.
