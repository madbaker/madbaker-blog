Not much to say today.  It was another lovely, sunny day, but I had indoor work for most of it.  I got out to the bowling club in the afternoon for a bit of practicing, but I think I'm over doing it a touch.  I am aware of far too many joints right now.

Instead, let me share two photos with you, proving beyond a doubt that the peonies in Beacon Hill Park are often as large as a human head.
