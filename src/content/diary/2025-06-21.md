The rains came for real overnight.  It was pouring down when I got up and was still a heavy drizzle when I set out for the Indigenous Block Party on Broad Street.  It was a rather small and soggy affair, but I took a good look at the handicrafts and then headed to James Bay in search of coffee beans.

The weather cleared a little in the afternoon and I got a text from a friend to go for a walk downtown.  We pretty much retraced my steps from the morning but had a good visit.  It was still jacket weather.  Three days of cool and rainy and we're all begging for sun again.  We're not easily satisfied when it comes to weather, eh?

The past few days have been a shambles, getting Cindy to Saskatchewan, lining up house sitters, making my own plans to get out to Regina, etc.  I think it's all settled now, so I am committed to going for a proper walk on Sunday, rain or shine.
