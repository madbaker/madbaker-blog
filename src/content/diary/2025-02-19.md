A real mix of sun and cloud today, with two big wind storms in the morning and again in the evening.  Weird.  

I planned to duck out for a walk in the morning but ended up on the phone for two hours, so my only excursion was picking Cindy up from school and taking her to a doctor's appointment.  I'll get out tomorrow, for sure.

I brought the daffodils in so they weren't uprooted by the wind.  Good move as one of them opened up overnight!
