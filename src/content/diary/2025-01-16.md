I haven't seen the water much lately, so I walked along Wharf Street and admired the sailboats in the harbour.  A harbour plane landed from directly over my head, which was quite impressive.  There's just enough of a breeze to put a chill into this sunny day.

Then it was a meander to Value Village and to Phillips for our weekend refreshments.  I met up with Stella from UP on the walk home, and had a nice chat until we got to her bus stop.  

It's sunny overhead but that means clouds across the straight.  But the clouds cleared enough to see the tops of the mountains from the hill on Yates Street, which always brightens my spirits.
