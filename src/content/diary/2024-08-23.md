_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

Two Dads Day today.  First to Wascana Rehab to visit Cin's dad.  On the walk in, I noticed a Sand Cherry for the first time.  I mean, it was always there, and I had heard about Sand Cherries, but I had never noticed _that_ was one of _those._  It ws covered in rough, furry fruit.  Like sand clumps.  I always thought they were named Sand Cherries because they grew in sandy soil.  Maybe both things are true.

Then to Moose Jaw for one more visit with my dad.  It was another day in the low 30's but we braved the outdoors again and sat in the shade once more.  

Back in Regina, I took a long look at a pair of crows in the front yard.  They look smaller and somehow sound smaller than the ravens on the coast.  I hadn't noticed that before.  I'll need to look more closely at the Victoria crows when we get home.
