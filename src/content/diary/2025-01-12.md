Cindy's intent on going to school tomorrow, so we stuck around home and got laundry and cleaning done.  We didn't miss much -- dark and gloomy with rain in the afternoon.  I skipped out before the rain to buy a lemon, but that was that really. 

When I don't get outside in real life, I get outside in my imagination.  I'm up to mid-May in Monty Don's garden diary.  His description of springtime lifts my spirits on these cold, gloomy indoor days.
