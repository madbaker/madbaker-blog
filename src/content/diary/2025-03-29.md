We took Wanda to the airport and then headed on towards Sidney for a walkabout.  It was mild and cloudy and fairly windy, but nice enough for a toodle around town.  Birdsong all around us.  Mostly, if not entirely, finches. That's the one call I can identify automatically now.  I just hope I don't lump too many other birds in with finches now.

I notice that my tulips go through a full daily bloom cycle.  Tight lipstick tubes in the early morning, but they open wider than most tulips by late afternoon.  They are a natural timepiece, although I suspect the sun is a better one and is driving the show anyway.
