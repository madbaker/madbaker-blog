It was a rainy, blustery day so I stuck around home while Cindy went for a mammoth walk up, down and around Mount Tolmie.  

My main nature efforts were in protecting the balcony flowers as the wind was gusting hard and blowing the tulips all over the place.  I only lost one flower to the wind, which proves that I panic a bit too much.
