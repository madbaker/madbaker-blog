Proper snow day, but not for Cindy.  She headed off to school as usual, but all my meetings were cancelled.  Pre-emptive cancellations in my mind.  I took a walk over to Thrifty Foods for the final few groceries and there was, at most, 2mm of snow on the ground.  But higher elevations and all that.  If you live up in Saanich or heaven forbid, Sooke or the Malahat, driving would be treacherous.  So folks stayed home.  Downtown is super quiet today.  

I got a call that my pottery class was cancelled too (getting a call was a surprise, but the cancellation was expected) so spent the afternoon cooking and writing letters.  There's not enough snow to go have fun in it.  Just enough for wet feet and cuffs.  So we'll see if anything sticks around tonight.
