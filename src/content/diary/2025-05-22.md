Today was a bit of a rough one, with my head full of family stuff, and a trip to the vet with Iggy, but I made it outside for a short walk in the late afternoon.  Much warmer today, so the afternoon sun felt good on my shoulders.  I headed down to the harbour to check out the boats and float planes, then back down Fort.  For some reason I wanted to check out the bookstores, but got scared off by the prices.  With new hardcovers running $40, it's good there's a library nearby.
