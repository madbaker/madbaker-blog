When I went to bed last night, I intended to walk to and from my stamp meetup today.  But I lollygagged in the morning so took the bus there, then hauled 48 cans of cat food and a bottle of olive oil home from Walmart, so took the bus home too.  Ah well.  The good news is that I had to walk a bit to and from the bus, enough to breath the sweet air of Victoria after a rain.  

We are solidly in the season of overnight rains, but the days have been sunny and cool.  Cindy suggested we make today our annual trip to Red Fish Blue Fish before they close for the season.  Their fish and chips are excellent but it's such a tourist destination that they have hour+ long lineups during summer.   Well, it was sunny but there was a cold breeze blowing off the water, so we ate quicker than we'd like and scurried home before dark.  

PS - the coffee beans from yesterday are decidedly average.  At least I won't be conflicted about buying them in the future.
