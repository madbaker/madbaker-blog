_We went to Regina to visit family from August 15 - 25.  Visiting family is fun but it means I wasn't keeping my online diary up to date.  So this post was actually written in late September, from my extremely sketchy notes. I debated whether to fill in these gaps.  I guess you know my decision now._

It was cloudy in the morning but no rain.  Once the clouds broke it heated up to the +30s again.  

I had my BLC call on the front deck, just me and a few squirrels at the bird feeder.  Later a crow attempted to pick the lock but the feeder is set up for smaller birds, so it left and a few sparrows took its place.  Nothing too exotic, but these are the first animals I've noticed in nearly a week.  

The animals are here, of course.  Notice the squirrels and you slow down a bit.  Then you can notice the jack rabbits in the field across the street.  Then you hear all the neighbour dogs plotting and scheming up and down the block.  

But Regina isn't built for noticing nature.  It's supposed to be enjoyed in a vehicle, hopefully a big one, endlessly driving from place to place, leaving the air conditioned car and running like hell for an air conditioned building.

Yes, I was born here.  I lived here for 53 years too.  The old habits settle in automatically.
