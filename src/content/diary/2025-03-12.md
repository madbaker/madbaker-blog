Another week without walking.  This working for a living has me all out of sorts.

In fairness, it's been quite rainy too, and not the 'rain at night, sun during the day' pattern that is more typical here.  It's been 'rain all day' more often than not.  But it's sunny as I write this and I'll be out in the sunshine soon enough.

Most of our outdoor time has been spent running from pharmacy to pharmacy tracking down a shingles vaccine and someone to inject it in us.  So much downtown travels, although it's lovely because the trees are all in bloom and looking their very best.  View Street, Blanshard, Yates, James Bay, all of it.  We're not at peak bloom yet but we're very close.

Closer to home, my spring broccoli is starting to flower after months of just sitting there.  I guess that's why they call it 'spring' broccoli.  I was going to pull one up as it wasn't moving at all and then I saw a tiny purple nodule forming.  Might try to eat some next week, as I hear they form tiny florets and not the large mounds of hybrid broccoli.  I'm excited to try it.
