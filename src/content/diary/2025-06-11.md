I woke up in a sad state, so spent most of the day indoors.  Went out in the morning for a 7/10 haircut, which is good for Victoria.  I haven't found a barber I like yet.  My big round head is now pointy somehow, but everything will grow back soon enough.

I got out for a walk through Beacon Hill Park in the afternoon, which cheered me up somewhat.  Too many tourists feeding the birds, often standing beside a 'do not feed the birds' sign, but oh well.  The plants are growing every day in this heat and it feels good to be surrounded by all this green life.
