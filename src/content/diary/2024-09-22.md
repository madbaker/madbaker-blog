It was a bit of a quiet day today, Cin getting ready for school as I took stock of the garden.  Everything is hanging on quite well, which means I'm starting to stress about my spring brocolli.  It should really go into a bigger pot soon.  And I need space for the spring bulbs.

With that in mind, I picked one tomato clean and pulled the plant.  The roots had gone down through the reservoir at the bottom of the pot, so I could barely get it out.  But now there's space for one plant.  I'll wait a week on the second tomato.  It's been cool enough that the fruit will ripen quicker inside, I think.

Here's a few Late September pics of the garden for the record.  I'm still stunned by the flowers.
