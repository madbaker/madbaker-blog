A bike ride!  I went on a bike ride!  OK, it was a short one, Cook - Dallas Road then around James Bay, but it counts.  First time on the bike in 2025.  

You see more on a bike, but nothing up close. I got a clear look at the bald eagle on top of the tallest totem pole though.  I don't wear my glasses cycling so the far away stuff is nice and clear for me.  

A walk!  I also went for a walk!  After lunch, I did the Phriday Phillips loop for weekend drinks.  Warm and breezy, but too many humans downtown for my liking.  It's OK to share the city, I guess.
