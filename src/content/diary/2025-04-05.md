The beautiful spring weather continued today, so we walked out to Oak Bay for the Spring Art Fair.  The fair was small yet interesting, but the real highlight was the walk.  If Thursday was Peak Cherry Tree, Saturday was Peakier, although the breeze was up and more petals were beginning to fall.

So many adventures along the way.  We found some baked goods at Moss Street Market, I heard a Downy Woodpecker along Thurlow Street, we bought two retro glass tumblers at the Ross Bay Villa yard sale, and bought two incredible sandwiches for lunch at Village Butcher.  Everything was perfect and we took the bus home completely satisfied.

Rain is coming, but the past week has been the most wonderful springtime. That little bit of heat and sun feeds the soul like nothing else.
