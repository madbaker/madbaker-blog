Thanksgiving Day today but since sun has disappeared, we spent most of the day indoors, having all those future focused conversations that we put off for a rainy day.  Our turkey was replaced with hot bowls of African peanut stew, which hit the spot.  It was a nice day of rest to complement a long weekend of high adventure.
