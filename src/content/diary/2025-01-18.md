We're in a stretch where the temperatures are brisk, nearly freezing overnight and highs of +5C or so, but the tradeoff is we have brilliant sunshine all day.  I'll take it.

Cin and I headed out for a walk around 11AM and headed across the Blue Bridge to Vic West, staying in the sun and sheltered from the north winds.  It was awesome, although for some reason that route always includes a political conversation. I don't know what triggers it. Possibly the luxury yacht mooring over there, but I was desperate to change the topic.  It was too lovely of a day.

We turned around at Spinnakers and headed back across the bridge to Chinatown, stopping for lunch at the Fan Tan Cafe.  Cin and Robyn had been there this summer but it was my first time, and I loved it.  Old school 'Canadian Chinese' in a tiny place with wild, colourful art on the walls.  What's not to love?  I ate far too much and was toast for the rest of the day.
