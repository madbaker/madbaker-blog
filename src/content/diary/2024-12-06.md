Today's walk was a short one, as I had several indoor jobs planned.  But my friend Chris and his wife Amy were arriving on the 11AM ferry from Seattle, so I wandered down to the Clipper terminal to surprise them.  

It was a calm, slightly grey morning, but mild.  A few tourists around along Belleville but nothing too wild.  The Coho was leaving as the Clipper arrived, so I got to watch two big ferries at once.  Great fun.

We're hitting the winter pattern where the sun sets before 4:30PM and the rain starts at 6PM, so there wasn't much time for great adventures in the daylight.  I walked Chris and Amy to their hotel, came home to start making pitas for supper, and made a quick run to the store for a cucumber.  Other than that, we hunkered down on the couch for the evening.  Bigger adventures await tomorrow.
