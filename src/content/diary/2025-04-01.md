Another day of walking for errands.  I had some banking to do and library holds to pick up, so made the downtown loop.  This is a very mild week with highs around +12C and most importantly, sunshine, so I strolled along the sunny side of the street for the entire walk, soaking up as many rays as possible.  The skies are clear enough that the Olympics were in full view and with the optical illusion from downtown, they towered above me in the southern sky, snowy and imposing.
