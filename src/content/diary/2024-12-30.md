Fully in the 'Twixmas' mood today.  We're on holidays and doing as little as possible.  The sun was out for the most part, so there was an extra special bit of joy in our steps as we headed out to Oak Bay rink to go skating.  

I haven't been on skates in at least 10 years and it took me a while to find my feet.  But after the first lap I was loving it and stayed on my blades with growing confidence.  I loved it.  

There are no outdoor rinks here, obviously, but the chill of the ice took me back to winters back home.  Ice in my lungs and awesome memories.
