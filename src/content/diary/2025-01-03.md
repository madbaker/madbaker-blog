Sorry folks.  Cindy's sick and it was raining steadily all day.  We both stayed indoors.

I watched one of the year-end specials of Gardener's World and read a few entries in [Monty Don's gardening diary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7156612-the-ivington-diaries) (my Christmas gift from Cindy) but that was all the nature I got today.
