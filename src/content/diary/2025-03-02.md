The finches out my window are coming closer.  I saw two on the balcony rail this morning.  Well, I heard them first, chirping loudly to make sure I was awake, then they flew off as soon as my eyes focused on them.  But they were there, for sure.

It was a home day, except for a late run to Bulk Barn for Cindy.  Generally sunny, but fully a city walk.  

My violet crocuses are all in bloom, but only open when the sun is on them.  Just like me.
