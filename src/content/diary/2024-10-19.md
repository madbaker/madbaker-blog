The rains came for real today.  Atmospheric River Conditions is what they call it.  All I know is that it pounded down all day.  

My cousin Cherie was in town with her daughter and remembered at the last minute that I live in Victoria now, so she reached out and we met at the Empress for a brief walk.  I haven't seen her in 8 years and possibly 20 years before that, but she looks just like she did when she was 18.  Although now, she has a daughter who is a senior in high school.  The three of us donned our rain gear and headed out for a brief walk around the harbour and over to Murchie's before I left them back at their hotel.  They were heading straight to the airport.  I'm so glad Cherie reached out, even if it was at the last minute.

In the evening Cindy and I walked to the Murder Burger pop-up on Fort Street.  We found a pocket of no-rain on the way there, but it was bucketing down for the walk home.  At least we were full.

I tend not to peek out from under my umbrella on these rainy walks.  It's something I need to get better at, because this is supposed to be a wetter than average winter.
