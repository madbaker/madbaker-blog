Two days in a row at UP.  My final practice shift before the owners take off on vacation.  I arrive early, finish early and the skies are clear when I walk home.  Lovely.  I'm finding my rhythm again.

In the evening, Cindy and I headed to Imagine Cafe for their pizza night.  We walk there in the dark, even though it's barely 5pm.  That's life on the coast.  But the pizza is excellent and on the way home we are treated to a spectacular full moon.  The sky is completely clear.  We can even see some stars.  It's going to be a cold one tonight.  Frost, perhaps?  But tomorrow is supposed to be clear and sunny and I plan to soak it up.
