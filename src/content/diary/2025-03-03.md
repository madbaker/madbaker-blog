My final pottery class was today, but work commitments left me taking the bus in both directions.  I got a bit of a walk to the grocery store around noon, taking a detour due to a pipe and drum parade blocking the street.  Only in Victoria.

I'm hearing much more birdsong now that I listen for it.  Partly due to Springtime, but I suspect mainly due to actually listening.  Who knew?

If I squint and focus really closely, I can see buds forming on the Big Oak.  It might be my imagination, though.  The oak's time will come.  Let the smaller trees flower for now.
