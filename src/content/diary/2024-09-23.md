It was rainy, I was not feeling awesome, and I had several calls during the day, so I didn't get outside much at all.  Made a run to the library to get a book for Cindy, took a bit of a loop home, but that's it.  

We're between cruise ships, so the neighbourhood was relatively quiet.  That's fine with me.

In the evening we went to see _Singing Back The Buffalo_ which was excellent.  My soul needed the wide open prairie vistas that featured throughout the documentary.  Heck, the first scene was in the Qu'appelle Valley.  

The ocean may be what I need now, but the prairies are in my bones.
