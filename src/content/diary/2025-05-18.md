Road Trip!  We got a car and headed out to Metchosin for the farmer's market.  It was intensely windy, with tents flapping and signs flying all over, but we did our best to support the vendors.  It's a tough life being at the whim of the weather.

The highlight of the day was stopping for lunch at Bilston Farm for brick oven pizza.  It's a lavender farm that has slowly diversified into a tourist destination.  Glamping tents, sauna, brick oven pizza, classes in a gorgeous barn/hall, weddings and the like.  The site was sheltered, the sun came out, and suddenly the farm was magical. Great pizza too.  We stayed for an extra long time, soaking up the warm sun and drinking in the scent of lavender and wood smoke.
