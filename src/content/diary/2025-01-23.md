Another early morning out, this time to Discovery Coffee in James Bay to for coffee with Jack and his son David.  Jack's moving down from Comox in April and was staying in the neighbourhood.  It was a good visit.

After, I headed towards downtown for weekend supplies and a pack of postcards.  Cheryl at the club inspired me to get back into Postcrossing, just as the mailing rates went up 25%.  So it's $1.24 to mail a postcard in Canada and $3.61 internationally.  Highway robbery.  The biggest issue is you can't get enough old stamps on a small postcard to pay the new rate and still leave space for an address and note.

It was chillier today. That thin cloud was slightly thicker.  Still lots of light, but the chill in the air went through my sweater and my jacket.  

There's a few seagulls who have taken up residence on our roof.  They swoop down low, along the front of our building, right beside our balcony and then off to Tapestry next door.  Then back, again nearly hitting the balcony glass, arcing up towards our roof. They're large birds and a scary contrast to the startling beauty of the hummingbirds when they come by.
