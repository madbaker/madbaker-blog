As usual, I bussed out to Cedar Hill for my Wednesday meetup before 9AM.  The walk along Gosworth was a delight as usual, as if all the front gardens were made just for me. 

After the meetup I walked over to Uptown Mall along a new route, up Cook Street to Tattersall, then down the hill to the mall.  It was a lovely day for a walk and the front gardens didn't disappoint.  I even saw a bit of an urban farm, with a walk in poly tunnel in the side yard.  

Evening was our final lawn bowling lesson.  I quite like it, and might join the club.  If I do there will be lots of rose garden photos in this diary, as their garden is excellent.
