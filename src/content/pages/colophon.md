This is at least the fifth iteration of my personal website, going back to 2006 or so.  

The pendulum keeps swinging back and forth, from wordpress.com to self-hosted wordpress, to multiple self hosted wordpress blogs, to a 'professional' site on Squarespace.  

But the trend towards block based editors makes me frustrated.  More and more, I just want to publish words.  Write a markdown file, proofread, and ship. 

A nostalgic afternoon reading all I could find on the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), the return (?) to personal websites and hand crafted pages re-ignited a fire that was smouldering inside me.  So it's a return to basics for me - minimal design and a focus on writing.

I took much more inspiration than made it into this iteration of the site, but here's where I'm at:


## What's in

The site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).   Eleventy lets me write markdown and publish with a single command and I am so grateful for that.  And its creator, leader, chief maintainer [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/) is earnest and funny in equal measure.

The site began via the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter but with some interesting (to me) additions:

- the way blog posts are listed are inspired by [Simon at Photogabble](https://photogabble.co.uk)
- I started adding short post descriptions after reading [Dana Byerly's](https://danabyerly.com/) blog and her [junk drawer](https://danabyerly-junkdrawer.website/)
- I'm refactoring much of the Eleventy configuration based on Lena Saile's [configuration model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaN-mifrWk) because it makes good sense to me.  

## What's to come

- As I learn more about CSS, I want to add the flowing space as deployed in Lena Saile's [Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/) starter, which is based on the ideas of [Andy Bell](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/). But I'm adding it bit by bit because my CSS skills are rudimentary and I want to understand what I'm doing.

- In the meantime, I'm cleaning up the base-blog css based on the ideas of Kev Quirk and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org).  Plain old HTML without CSS classes.  Again, it's more a case of getting the styles back to the studs so I can learn as I go.  I'm using that as my base and adding on what I need to get to Andy's vision, as my knowledge grows.  Right now, every time I dive into the CSS files I'm wondering what I was doing the last time!  This is going to take a while.

- Typography is ever changing.  If you're seeing serifs, it's likely the Newsreader font.  But I switch between that and [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible), which I learned about via [Erik Kroes](https://www.erikkroes.nl/).  

- Thanks to [Henry](https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-convert-variable-ttf-font-files-to-woff2/) I got Newsreader installed as two compact variable webfont files.

## Perpetual Construction

So.  I'm going to be adding more words -- new words and bringing back old words from my 15+ years of baking and blogging.  

And at the same time, I'll be changing how the words look.  Tweaking styles, adding stuff in an [unhurried way](https://bnijenhuis.nl/notes/unhurried-development/).  What fun.
