# About Me

Hi, I'm Mark and I'm a baker.  I also write things and I talk a whole bunch too.

## Things I'm doing

- I'm mixing scones, rolling cinnamon buns and stuffing croissants most mornings at [Union Pacific Coffee](https://www.unionpacificcoffee.ca/) in Victoria, BC.
  
- My podcast, [Rise Up! The Baker Podcast](http://riseuppod.com) has been going since 2018.  I have conversations with professional bakers and bakery owners from around the world.

- I founded an online community for professional bakers and bakery owners in 2020, called [Bakers4Bakers](https://bakers4bakers.org)

## Things I've done

Lots!  

## About this website

This is where all my writing goes.  From at least five disparate blogs and websites going back to 2006.  I have a website problem, you see.  I start them, and fill them up, then abandon them for a new project.  But in the spring of 2023 I finally pulled them all into one spot.  Or will be soon.  I think I'm up to ~~2012~~ ~~2013~~ 2014 now.  Blogs you've never heard of, like:

- _My Voice is in here somewhere_, my first wordpress blog from 2006 - 2010 or so, including two awesome family vacation memoirs and my formative baking education at the San Francisco Baking Institute
- _Orange Boot Bakery (at home edition)_, the first iteration of our bakery
- _Orange Boot Bakery_, five years of mayhem an awesomeness on Gordon Road, Regina.
- _The Backyard Bakery_, my return to the brick oven and a more connective, personal baking experience
- _Ready With Shoes On_, a travel blog with field updates from a three month trip to Europe

And more recent posts from my time coaching, storytelling and community-building work.

Onward!
