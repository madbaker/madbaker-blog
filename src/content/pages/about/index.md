# About Me

Hi, I'm Mark and I'm a baker.  I also write things and I talk a whole bunch too.

## Things I'm doing

- My podcast, [Rise Up! The Baker Podcast](http://riseuppod.com) has been going since 2018.  I have conversations with professional bakers and bakery owners from around the world.

- I founded an online community for professional bakers and bakery owners in 2020, called [Bakers4Bakers](https://bakers4bakers.org)

- In 2024, I co-founded a workshop  with the Bread Bakers Guild of America called [The Bakery Leadership Circle](https://bbga.org/bakery-leadership-circle), where a small cohort of bakery owners and leaders work together to tackle their biggest business decisions and leadership challenges.

- I'm currently looking for part-time work in my new hometown of Victoria, BC.  Something where I can help people directly; there is such a thing as too much Zoom.
  
## Things I've done

If you're inclined to dig through my [writing archives](/writing/) you'll uncover a few layers of past projects and adventures.  Some work highlights from front to back:

- I was a coach at [Seth Godin's altMBA](https://altmba.com) program and head coach of Akimbo's [Story Skills Workshop](https://storyrepublic.com/#workshop) from 2017 through 2022.
  
- My friend Bernadette Jiwa and I launched [the Right Company](https://therightcompany.co) in 2018 and I was the Chief Community Advocate there until the end of 2021.
  
- I've run a few bakeries.  Cindy and I opened Orange Boot Bakery in 2011 and ran it for five years.  There was a proto-Orange Boot, run out of my garage, starting around 2008. And there was a post-Orange Boot, called (creatively) The Backyard Bakery, back in the garage, after we closed Orange Boot in 2015.
  
- And before all of that, I had a career in Telecom from 1989 - 2010.   I tried to get folks turned on to blogging early on, starting a small local community blog and an example business blog.  Some of those posts are here too.

But outside of all the projects and businesses and community building and coaching work, I keep coming back to writing about three things: connection, community and collaboration.  As in, working together, human to human, to make our lives inwardly rich and our world healthy and vibrant.  

## About this website

This is where all my writing goes.  From at least five disparate blogs and websites going back to 2006.  I have a website problem, you see.  I start them, and fill them up, then abandon them for a new project.  But in the spring of 2023 I finally pulled them all into one spot. Blogs you've never heard of, like:

- _My Voice is in here somewhere_, my first wordpress blog from 2006 - 2010 or so, including two awesome family vacation memoirs and my formative baking education at the San Francisco Baking Institute
- _Orange Boot Bakery (at home edition)_, the first iteration of our bakery
- _Orange Boot Bakery_, five years of mayhem an awesomeness on Gordon Road, Regina.
- _The Backyard Bakery_, my return to the brick oven and a more connective, personal baking experience
- _Ready With Shoes On_, a travel blog with field updates from a three month trip to Europe

And more recent posts from my coaching, storytelling and community-building work.

Onward!
