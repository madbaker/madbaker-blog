## Enhancements
- make the libsyn embed a plugin, as part of the embed-everything package.  If I use the oEmbed standard is it a universal plugin?


## Overall

- Fluid typefaces
~~- Display typeface and Base typeface~~
~~- bring over favicons from 'andy' site~~
~~youtube embed~~
~~libsyn embed~~
~~add schemas and opengraph meta-content to base.njk~~
- make a default opengraph image:  1280x672

- refactor filters, shortcodes and includes to come closer to Lena's model

- refactor css to implement simple.css 
  
- remove extra font-faces and possibly pre-load the ones I'm keeping?

- design and style the footer content

~~get the blog posts in the same order in Journal / Summaries, home page, yy/mm pages~~

## Home Page

~~- do I add an excerpt for each post?~~
  
## Blog Archives
~~- generate pages by year and month~~

/blog/yy/mm

## Blog Page
