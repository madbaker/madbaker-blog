title: "Google Maps Has Transit Info"

I'm a winter bus rider and one of the things that bugs me is how tough it is to get transit information. Yes, our city transit authority has a [web site](http://www.reginatransit.com/) but it's touch to navigate, with a user interface that was poor in 2002, let alone today.

But today I read that Google Maps has expanded to offer transit information as part of their mapping service. If your transit organization [submits the data](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm), bus stops and stop times will be displayed on the map.

I'll notify the appropriate authorities and am just jiggly with anticipation...

UPDATE: Well, it was harder than I thought to leave a comment on the Regina Transit site but it's done. If you've got some time on your hands, check out the 'contact us' process [here](http://www.reginatransit.com/1_Rts_contact_us.html) which sends you [here](http://www.reginatransit.com/1_Rts_contact_us.html#5), [here](http://www.regina.ca/citycentralrequests.shtml) and finally [here](http://66.179.23.21/DP1/Metroplex/Regina//customerservice/starthere.asp) (three screens of info to fill in including manditory country and home phone number fields!)
