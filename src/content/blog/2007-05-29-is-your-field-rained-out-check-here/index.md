I promise that this site won't just break down the City of Regina site (unless you like that sort of thing) but I just noticed that you can check the web site to see whether your soccer field or ball diamond got rained out.

No real link, since they just slam the info on the [home page](http://regina.ca/) (look for the header of Athletic Fields) so you'll have to check back, but they did publish a phone number. So now I will too: (306) 777-7484.

Now you know.
