Our construction work is still in progress, but we can't wait any longer -- we need to bake! Here's hoping you're in need of some bread this week too.

This is a 'back to basic' week. Three loaves which are the building blocks of all the bread we make. But don't let that deter you! Sometimes the simplest things are the best:

#1: Our multigrain loaf is our best seller. OK, it's also the most offered loaf but people really seem to like it. This large sandwich loaf contains corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and honey in addition to wheat flour giving a complex and slightly sweet flavour. It's the mainstay of our breakfast routine.

- Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00

#2: Our semolina loaf (_Pane Siciliano_) doesn't the love it deserves -- until you taste it. This deep brown 'S' shaped loaf contains Durum flour in the dough and roasted sesame seeds on top. It's Cindy's favorite. Yummy!

- Semolina Loaf (_Pane Siciliano_), 500g loaf, $3.50

#3: There's nothing ordinary about our _Pain Ordinaire_ - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.

- French Loaf (_Pain Ordinaire_), 700g Batard, $3.50

As is our custom â€” please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, November 9 and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.

We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don't hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.

Best wishes this week!

=== What's Happening at the Orange Boot? ===

So we have power in the garage and we have a furnace in the garage. But we don't have power connected to the furnace yet. Brrr!

Our week away from baking meant we put a great many hours into getting the prep / pickup area cleaned up, but there is still a lot of work to do. So pickup is in the house for at least another week. It's getting there, though.
