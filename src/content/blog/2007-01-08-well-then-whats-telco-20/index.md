Telco 2.0: A research and consulting initiative created by [STL](http://www.stlpartners.com/), a UK based consulting company.

Telco 2.0: (from their [manifesto](http://www.telco2.net/manifesto/)):

”“Telco 2.0™” defines any business model where connectivity is supported by a sustainable economic model. This means the end of artificial cross-subsidies between services and connectivity. We assume an all-IP world where choice of applications, devices and platforms is entirely driven by user preference. Connectivity charges will increasingly reflect actual costs of delivery (unlike, say, mobile roaming charges); relatively trivial services like standard voice call routing are effectively free; and thus the scope for the latter subsidising the former ceases to exist Customers will only take your replacement offering because they want it, not because they have no choice.”

WHAT IF: we could use some of their business model frameworks when assessing our Service Development arenas?
