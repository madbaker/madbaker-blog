Tip of the hat to [Hugh Macleod](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/003856.html) for pointing me to [Johnny Moore](http://www.johnniemoore.com/blog/archives/001690.php) for one of the scariest videos I've ever seen. Not 'Nightmare on Elm Street' scary, but creepy scary. It's so bad it has to be a spoof, but the production values are really good. How can this happen?
