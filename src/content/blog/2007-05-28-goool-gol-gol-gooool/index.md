Great day! It finally connected that we'll be in Victoria BC while the [FIFA U-20 World Cup](http://fifa.com/en/comp/index/0,2442,U20M2007,00.html?comp=U20M&year=2007) is underway. I got online and am now the proud owner of 4 tickets to the July 7 matches. We'll get to see Uruguay vs. Zambia and Japan vs. Nigeria. Should be great fun.

It's very unlikely that we'll be going to the 2010 Olympics so this is the closest thing to a world class sporting event I'll get to see. I'm very excited.
