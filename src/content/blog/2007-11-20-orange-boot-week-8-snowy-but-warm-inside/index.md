This is our eighth week of baking for friends and family. Two month’s worth of good bread, prepared with care every Friday. It’s extremely gratifying to see the smiles and hear the great comments about our bread. We really appreciate it – frankly, making a direct happy contribution to your weekend is a big reason why we’re doing this in the first place!

We’re approaching the time of year where many of us are heading out to Christmas parties, pot luck suppers or maybe even hosting a gathering of your own. We think we can help you out a bit in this regard, by offering two very special breads to go along with our regular fare (which is special in its own way!) So you will see two special loaves each week from now till the New Year. One sweet, one savory – either will make a nice gift, pot luck contribution or decadent treat for a winter evening in.

This week’s offerings:

#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large sandwich loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!

- Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00

#2: Saskatchewan Sourdough: Flour, water and salt. Take three simple ingredients, add lots and lots of time, and you get the most complex and delightful flavour possible. If Mark was stranded on a desert island, this is the bread he’d want.

- Saskatchewan Sourdough, 700g Batard, $3.50

#3 (Sweet Special): Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread. This is a very pretty sweet loaf, with six strands of dough all braided together and baked till a golden brown. A luxurious treat with a hint of oranges and as many cranberries and nuts as we can cram in there! We were sampling this loaf last Friday and got 100% huge grins from everyone who tried it!

- Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread, 850g Braided Loaf, $7.00

Note: This is slightly smaller than the 1.2kg behemoth we served up last week, to make it a little more manageable for you. If you’ve got a large gathering, we’d be glad to make the big ‘un for you for $9.00.

#4 (Savory Special): Herb and Garlic Focaccia. This amazing flatbread is built over two days for maximum flavour and then we go over the top with olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs. Wow! This is sold as a slab which you can cut up for guests or tear apart with gusto.

- Orange Boot Herb Focaccia, 8”x12” slab, $4.00

As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery. We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don't hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.

=== What's Happening at the Orange Boot? ===

We’ve got heat in the garage! Yay! We’re still mixing in the house, but fermentation, shaping and proofing has moved to the garage to be closer to the oven. Your bread is also available for pickup in the garage too. Please come on in!
