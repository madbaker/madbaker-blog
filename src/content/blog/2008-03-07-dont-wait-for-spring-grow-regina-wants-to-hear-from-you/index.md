Just got a comment from John Fagan at [Grow Regina](http://growregina.ca/ "Grow Regina") -- they're taking applications for community garden plots right now, so head over there and sign up!

John mentioned that they have different sized plots this year, so you can put in a couple tomatoes or 500 hills of potatoes, whatever gives your green thumb some pleasure!!

It's reason enough for me to add them to the 'lots o' links' section in the sidebar too.

So [sign up](http://growregina.ca/ "Grow Regina") already!
