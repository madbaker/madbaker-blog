Wow! I now know what a wet dough really is. The verb we used to describe the dough as we were dividing the dough was 'swimming.' And it was.

The loaves in the pictures were massive, yet light as a feather. 10 inches square yet only weighed 600 grams.

Another neat technique I learned -- you need to dry these out in the oven a bit before unloading to drive out all the steam. Makes for a much crispier crust.
