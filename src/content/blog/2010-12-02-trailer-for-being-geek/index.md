One of my favorite blogs is [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/) (it's a must read, people!) Michael just wrote a book called [Being Geek: the Software Developer's Career Handboo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596155409?ie=UTF8&tag=beigee-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596155409)k and [the trailer](http://beinggeek.com) is awesome.

The performance review scene is dedicated to my friend [Melvis](http://radiofreemel.com/).
