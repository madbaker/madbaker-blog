Vi Hart puts math in order by [ignoring his teacher and doodling](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/11/29/learning-math-by-ign.html). From Cory Doctorow:

> Vi Hart’s “Mathematical Doodling” is a series of hilarious and informative narrated videos explaining doodle-games that you can play to explain mathematical concepts in a way that’s much more intuitive than the traditional math-class methodologies. \[Here\] is binary trees, but be sure and click through to “Snakes + Graphs” — a wonderful, captivating potted graph theory explanation.
