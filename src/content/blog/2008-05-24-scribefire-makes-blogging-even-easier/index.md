[ScribeFire](http://www.scribefire.com/) is a plugin for Firefox which integrates my web surfing and blogging in a very easy way.  
  
It's integrated right into this blog, so when I see an interesting web page I can get an editor up and running without leaving the web page. I can format the post, assign categories and publish with one click. Easy!  
  
There are also some really neat integrations with popular social media sites so I can stumble, digg, etc all without leaving the page.  
  
Even the picture on this post was inserted with ScribeFire. One button and I'm searching Flickr or YouTube and inserting images and videos with a click.  
  
First impression is that this is a way cool plugin. If you blog, it's a must-have!

(_Update: whatever picture I linked to in 2008 doesn't exist in 2023!_)
