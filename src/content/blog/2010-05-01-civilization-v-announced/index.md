OK, I'm a little late on this, because it the announcement came in February. But i'm very excited to learn there is a new version of Civ coming out in the Fall. Civilization IV is my all time favourite PC game and I can hardly wait for the new version.

When Civ IV came out in 2005, gamers all over had to upgrade their PCs to handle the graphics and calculation complexity. I wonder if this will be the excuse I need to upgrade my laptop!
