It's been a fun three days.  I decided to make some changes to my hosting setup, which changed the location of this blog among other things.

After several emails to my [hosting](http://www.hostpapa.ca/) support, including one step that only they could perform, I have my hosting configured properly.  My bakery website is not completely moved to a new hosted wordpress environment [_the Rainmaker Platform_] and this host is configured for this blog and a some other blogging ideas I have.  The skeleton of my next project is underway [_which turned into the travel blog, Ready With Shoes On_].

The biggest unforseen hiccup was that I was without email for two days.  One day for the hosting folks to make their change and one to adjust all my MX records properly.  But even that's all working now.

Onwards and upwards!
