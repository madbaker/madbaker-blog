This afternoon I realized that a great many customers didn't receive the invitation for Thanksgiving bread that I emailed out on Saturday. My initial reaction was relief since I was starting to get worried about the lack of orders but it seems now that it was just the case that nobody knew we were open. Wow, talk about the best kept secret in town!

I suspect the problem was that I put the word 'Order' in the subject line, or perhaps it was my sending email address. If your spam filter allows white-listing, I sure would appreciate you putting mark@madbaker.com in your 'allowed list.' If this becomes a lingering problem I'll investigate a bulk email service.

Subscribing to this web site (using the subscription links in the sidebar) is one way to make sure you always get the latest updates from the bakery.
