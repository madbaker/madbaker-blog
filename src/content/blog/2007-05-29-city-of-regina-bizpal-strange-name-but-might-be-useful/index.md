While I was building out the links (psst: over there, on the right sidebar --> ) I stumbled across a wacky banner on the City of Regina web site. Turns out they've launched a service called [BizPal.](http://www.regina.ca/content/business/bizpal/bizpal.shtml) It appears to be a wizard to guide you through the complex but very important processes involved in obtaining a business permit or license.

While digging around a little it seems to be a 'national' app. I can get a license in the Yukon if I like.

Might take a while to find on the city site but the link above takes you right to the wizard. Now stop selling those muffins door to door and go get legal!
