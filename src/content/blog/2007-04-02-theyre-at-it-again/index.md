[New feature for Highrise](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/348-highrise-public-contact-cards-from-idea-to-feature-to-launch-in-48-hours). Concept to launch in 48 hours, along with rationale for the change published to all their customers and the public at large.

Simply amazing. How can companies afford to be closed with this going on?
