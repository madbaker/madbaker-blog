Hello awesome person,

## Winter Nostalgia

It's inevitable.  2024 is behind us and 2025 is ahead.  How strange is that?  I mean, _2025_?  Twenty **Twenty Five?!?!**  No way.  I have this vivid memory of watching the Millenium fireworks shooting off Sydney Harbour Bridge to kick off the new Millenium, followed by a repeat every hour on the hour, from the next time zone.  I know, I know, technically it was a year early, but we didn't care then and I don't care now.  No matter what, there's no way that all happened a quarter century ago.  I refuse to believe it.  It's a dirty trick brought on by those darn Tories, I tells ya.

I'm intensely nostalgic this holiday season.  We've been away from 'home', meaning Saskatchewan, for over five years now and I surely miss it.  In small doses.  Like this Christmas, when friends and family sent me photos of clear blue skies and the crispest, brightest, whitest snow and stands of birch trees all covered in sparkly hoar frost.  Definitely a white Christmas back home.  Gorgeous.  It was also -32C the week before this festive beauty; only my sister sends me _those_ texts.

We had our fun on the coast, for sure.  The sun was out in force on Christmas Eve so Cindy and I went for a hike to Ross Bay, Gonzales Beach and then on the our 'height of land', the lookout at Walburn Park in Oak Bay.  The tide was in and more storms were forecast, so there was literally no beach, only water and stacks of massive driftwood logs which have been gathering and crashing in and flipping their driftwood buddies (and one sailboat) higher and higher up the retaining walls.  

But just like a prairie cold snap, it didn't last.  The sun went behind clouds and the tides went out.  We went back to Ross Bay on Boxing Day and the beach was back.  Most of the logs were floating in the bay, bobbing along, looking for the the next party.  But my goodness, there were a lot of logs.  I don't think a boat of any size dared venture into the bay until these wooden ne'er-do-wells had dispersed.

Like I say, I'm nostalgic.  I needed the proper Christmas food this year and by George I indulged.  I've eaten all Cindy's Christmas cookies, both my share and, thanks to the mail strike, the niece's and nephew's share too.  (She's sending fresh this week.)  Cin went to the Ukrainian hall sale for frozen perogies and we found two excellent fruitcakes at the holiday markets.  Cin doesn't even like fruitcake, so I've eaten most of two full cakes by myself.  We have our annual splurge on chip dip for New Year's Eve and I have new flannel pyjama pants to lounge in.  I'll deal with a belt next year.

But the peak of winter nostalgia was this very afternoon, when Cindy and I went skating.  The City rinks here have skate rentals, both hockey skates and figure skates and they're proper leather ones too.  Incredible.  So we laced 'em up and headed out.  Scariest thing I did in 2024, if I'm honest. At the very least, it's been 10 years since I've been on skates and it took a few laps for the muscle memory to kick in.  Not exactly 'like riding a bike.'  They have a big bin of helmets and I really should've worn one, if only for the big step down to ice level, but my prairie vanity won out.  

After 10 minutes or so, I was back in the groove and loving every second, dodging little kids and beginners and those highly unpredictable hand-holding couples with a tiny bit of speed and grace.  I even did a cross over!  Like all nostalgia, it was definitely better in my imagination than to any impartial observer, but I don't care.  It was brilliant and I can't wait to go back.  I just hope we go in the opposite direction next time.  The practice of reversing direction every 20-30 minutes hasn't crossed the Rocky Mountains, so we spent 45 minutes turning left.  Ah well.

## I'm fun in small doses

2024 has been the Year of the Project, it seems.  I've done some work that I'm really proud of, but in short bursts.

The big one is the [Bakery Leadership Circle](https://bbga.org/BLC) a leadership and change program for bakery owners and senior leaders.  I launched it back in February with my friend Karen of the BBGA and it's been awesome.  Ever since I took the altMBA in 2017 and was asked to coach that program, I wanted to do something similar but specifically for bakery owners.  As I've learned more and grown and changed over the years, my ideas have changed too, and all this has gone into the Leadership Circle.  We ran two sessions this year and have already announced a session for Spring 2025.  I can't wait to meet the new cohort of bakers.

I say "small doses" because, even though the BLC took most of my creative time this year, the Circle only meets once per week.  A smaller dose, but just as fun, was filling in as a 'guest baker' back at Union Pacific in November.  Kelley and Lindsay needed a vacation and they didn't want to close and leave the crew hanging, so I did the baking for them for two weeks.  It was so much fun, dancing the dance of a brief but active production schedule again.  And I got to work with the most incredible trio of young, smart, fun cooks after my  morning bake was done.  There's nothing better than a team that works well together.

An even smaller dose that rewarded me with fresh pizza, was a baker meetup in September by the Baking Association of Canada.  I got to moderate a panel discussion with some incredible local bakery owners, which was a ton of fun.  And then we ate pizza.  Even better.

Even my social time is best in small doses.  I have a weekly 'muffin meetup' with local stamp collectors at a nearby rec centre.  90 minutes, some good visiting, a bit of show and tell, then I'm good for a week.  They let me design a poster for their quarterly stamp shows which only caused a minor furor; maybe that's too big of a dose of the ol' Mark magic.

## My Year's Best List

It's been ages since I shared some fun finds with you, so here's a recap of the best things I saw this year.  There's a very strong British tinge to these recommendations, but all are available around the world:

**Best Podcast that isn't my own**

I'm cheating right off the bat.  I've got two to share, both from the same umbrella company. 

- I started listening to [The Rest is Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/@TheRestIsEntertainment) because I love Marina Hyde's columns for the Guardian.  She and the multi talented Richard Osman share secrets about the ins and outs of show business every week.  I got hooked when they started arguing about the right way to sort their books.

- The Rest of Entertainment is fun, but I'm totally hooked on [The Rest is History](https://www.youtube.com/@restishistorypod)  Wow!  Two historians telling wildly entertaining stories for over an hour each week. And some of the series span 6 episodes or more.  Want five hours on the French Revolution?  The beginnings of World War I?  Horatio Nelson?  The 1968 US Presidential Election?  Yes!  Yes you really do.  This podcast is excellent.  I started with the 1968 election series right after the 2024 results sunk in I started finding some perspective.  Seriously, this is a good show.

To get you started, here's the first episode in the '1968' series:

## Bakery Leadership Circle Update

{% imagePlaceholder "./img/BLC-Logo.jpg", "Bakery Leadership Circle Logo: Some bakery challenges require more than a recipe" %}

The last time I wrote you I mentioned that applications are open for the next session of the [Bakery Leadership Circle](https://bbga.org/Bakery-Leadership-Circle), the workshop I created with Karen Bornarth of the Bread Bakers Guild of America.   Applications are starting to come in but we still have room for some more bakery owners and leaders to join us.

Next Tuesday, June 4, Karen and I are holding a **live information session** on Zoom to share more details about the program, hear from alumni from our first session and answer any questions you might have about the workshop.  You can [register for the call here.](https://bbga.org/Bakery-Leadership-Circle)

If you're a bakery owner who knows you need to change and adapt, but aren't actually making the change, this workshop is for you.  If you care about a bakery owner who needs some support, this workshop might be just what they need.  Come check it out and let's get started, together.

That's it for this week.  Stay healthy, stay safe, enjoy each day.  What would it feel like to treat every day as a bonus day?
