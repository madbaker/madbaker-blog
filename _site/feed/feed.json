Moving intentionally, with a view of contributing to the community is even more difficult.  But Sage Dilts and Nathan Hodges have done just that with their farm and bakery on Lopez Island, Washington.</p>\n<p>This is an awesome talk, ranging from when Sage and Nathan met in grad school in the Bay Area, where Sage developed her baking chops, how they found their way to Lopez Island and how the locals embraced their quest to make the best bread from the localist grains.  And how Barn Owl Bakery is feeding their village.</p>\n<p>Alan Scott and other mentors make recurring appearances in the journey, as a mentor and guide.</p>\n<p>As I listened to our conversation again, I was struck by how important it was to Sage and Nathan to give something to their new community, rather than simply move in and enjoying the natural beauty.  They're both committed to making the earth a better place and they're doing it through service.  I love that.</p>\n<p>But don't take my word for it!  Listen for yourself below.</p>\n",

I think it's quicker than that.</p>\n<p>I got bent out of shape last week over some chocolate croissants.  No more than 15 chocolate croissants.  I wanted to help out and shape them and was encouraged not to.</p>\n<p>What was heard, according to me, was that I don't shape them well and it would be easier for someone else to do it than show me what my technique lacked.  And that I was a simple, fat hairy oaf who smelled bad, talked odd and had literal sausages for fingers.</p>\n<p>What was said, according to the speaker, was that I had already done more than expected, was looking tired and hey, why not head on home and we'll go again tomorrow.  Can I make you lunch before you go?  And by the way, have you lost weight?  You're looking pretty good these days.</p>\n<p>What was ACTUALLY said?  Who knows?  The entire conversation could be recorded, we could both listen to it and still hear the two conversations above.</p>\n<p>So given that nothing is real, what are we to do?</p>\n<p>Give more grace.  Lots more grace.  To me.  To you.  To us and them and everyone.</p>\n<p>Good, bad or neutral, we heard it wrong.  And <em>that's</em> a scientific fact.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Serendipity, emails and rabbit holes have taken me far, far down Memory Lane today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I got an email from my friend Mar, who I haven't talked to in a few years.  She was thinking about Hot Cross Buns and how, that first Easter when we opened Orange Boot Bakery, we turned her partner Bruce away empty handed at least three times on the Saturday before Easter.  We just didn't know how to hold orders yet.  After we closed we took the last dozen buns (which I think were reserved for Cindy's mom), looked up their address and brought them to the house.  It's been 12 years and they haven't forgotten.</li>\n<li>So we got to chatting and Mar reminded me of the name Beth Traynor, who ran an awesome little catering business out of a small shop on Robinson and 13th Avenue.  Beth made the best carrot cake (among other delicious food).   She even made the carrot cake for our wedding over 30 years ago and I was sad to forget her name, and glad to now remember it again.  Beth's long since retired and she is still missed in Regina.</li>\n<li>In other news, my search of personal website inspiration (that I might 'steal' for this site) took me to a brand new  (to me) website by <a href=\"https://www.carolynzhang.com/\">Carolyn Zhang</a>.  She wrote <a href=\"https://www.carolynzhang.com/2020/introduction\">a masterful pair of essays</a> on her experience designing campaign software on the fly for the 2020 US election and how the experience affected her personally. Wow.  Deep reflection on how doing work that matters to you often conflicts with internal narratives that have built up over a lifetime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PS - my personal website 'research' also took me to a blog that I read 20 years ago and haven't been to in over 15.  It's still going strong. What a thrill thrill to dig through the archives and remember what I was reading before my baking life.  Then, sadly, I read the new stuff.  Let's just say that he didn't seem to be such a crank in 2004.  I shall not be sharing a link.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Yet another habit that needs reinforcing.  It's too easy to slide into dark talk when in actual fact, there is much good in the world, and much good inside me.</p>\n<p>Here are five of those good things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The massive dark cloud which seems to frame The Empress Hotel most evenings dissipated in time for the most brilliant spring sunset.</li>\n<li>Cherry trees and magnolias are in bloom all over Victoria, which make my walks to and from work magical.  I'm so lucky to live in this beautiful city.</li>\n<li>Cindy made pancakes!  Which is excellent full stop.  But triply so because tomorrow is a 'wheat day' for my elimination / re-integration diet, so I shall be having leftover pancakes for breakfast.</li>\n<li>I stumbled across <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22571656\">The Happiness Equation</a> which Cin found in a Free Little Library box and I had left in the back bedroom.  Upon re-opening, the first thing I read reminded me that <em>I love working on teams</em> and that teamwork is very important to me.  Which is lacking at UP.  We get along, but we're not a team.  Or I'm not feeling it.  Glad I remembered something that's important to me but currently lacking.</li>\n<li>A question on B4B has reminded me how difficult but amazing Easter baking was at Orange Boot.  And it follows on that...</li>\n<li>Bakers4Bakers is a good place.  I'm grateful for the people who share and learn and grow there.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It took me 3/4 of Blonde on Blonde to make it (all but Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands) and honestly, it's just hot walking. I got to see the back side of Disney though, which is interesting in its own way. If I was ever making a James Bond film, I'd film it there; all the unmarked white vans, security checkpoints, severe tire damage gates and electrical generators would make a great villains lair.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Once across the I-5, I thought I was coming up to a light security prison, or a half way house maybe.

Each building was two or three classrooms with private entrances and a asphalt playground in the middle. Whoo boy would it be hot on that playground! I know security is a big thing in schools these days but man, they are taking it a little far at Orange Grove School if you ask me.

			"content_html": "<p>I've been to Anaheim before, but it's been a while.</p>\n<p>Aside from weekend fishing and camping trips, I only took two family vacations with my parents. The first, when I was 10, was a three week trip to Windsor and Detroit (via Bemidji Minnesota and Niagara Falls) for my cousin Mary Catherine's wedding.</p>\n<p>The second was to Anaheim and Disneyland.</p>\n<p>We came in March, when I was in Grade 7. I remember just how green everything was; from the moment we left the airport I couldn't believe all the green grass everywhere. Even the school fields were lush and green! We had prairie scrub at Ruth M. Buck school. Mixed with gravel. If you fell on the playground you were guaranteed a scraped knee and quite possibly some embedded stones. And anyway, it was St. Patrick's Day; my playground at home would be covered in snow for at least a month yet.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>ahh, vacations... This way we have room for Granny!</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>There were five of us on the trip. My Aunty Donna, mom's youngest sister, was still single and flew down with us. She was the most important person in my 12 year old world; it hadn't been that long since she'd been living in our basement on Bruce Street and then in her own apartment in Regina. We'd watch the Carol Burnett Show together on TV every Thursday night and laugh like crazy. And she'd let me read her old Mad Magazines and listen to her Donovan and Beatles records. She was so cool. But now she lived in Calgary, which would become the exotic escape for my sister Wanda and me for years to come. So we were thrilled she was coming on this big vacation with us.</p>\n<p>Donna had a job working in PR at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, and she brought along a small bag of promotional material about Calgary. Since it was 1978, 10 years before the Winter Olympics would put Calgary on the world map, promotion was a big deal. But also, since it was 1978, it was still funny to roll up a fact sheet about Calgary, written in a tiny font on a small piece of paper, and put it in a clear plastic capsule. The fact sheet was titled &quot;DOPE About Calgary&quot; but all that showed on the capsule was the &quot;DOPE&quot; part.</p>\n<p>That's right, my hip, cool Aunt brought a baggie of white plastic capsules labelled DOPE on our family trip to California. You know what happened: she got picked for a random search at the airport, was asked about the baggie, and said &quot;That's my dope!&quot; Our time at the airport was a little longer than we planned.</p>\n<p>We did everything you'd expect on a 70's romp through Southern California. We went to Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Universal Studios. We took the bus tour to San Diego and Sea World, stopping at the mission at San Capistrano to see the swallows. We took a tour of Hollywood, saw the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre. It was a blast.</p>\n<p>Back then, Disneyland was a single park, ringed with tiny motor hotels and there was one big fancy hotel called the Disneyland Hotel. We stayed in a little motor inn, right across the street from the main Disneyland parking lot. The motel we stayed in wasn't all that different from the Alamo Inn that Robyn and I are staying in now, in fact. Although the this area has changed a lot in 35 years.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Our motel. Good beds, great air conditioner, horrid WIFI</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>Now there are two Disney parks side by side; the original Disneyland and a park called Disney California Adventure. Between the two parks are at least four huge Disney hotels and a shopping street called Downtown Disney, where you can buy mouse ears and a shirt even if you can't afford a ticket inside (a whopping $160USD per person per day now!) And while there's still several classic motor inns around the park, there are also Hiltons and Marriots and Hamptons and all the other chains too.</p>\n<p>I think California Adventure is where the old parking lot used to be. The parking lot for visitors is several blocks away now; there is a &quot;Toy Story&quot; bus line that constantly shuttles people to and from the parking lot.</p>\n<p>And they do a lot of shuttling! Disneyland is still a massive draw from what I can see. Every morning, the hotels around us empty my 8:30AM. Half the folks head east to the convention centre, wearing their red, purple or blue VidCon badges. But far more people head north one block to Disneyland, in groups of four or six or eight, typically pushing a stroller, often with grandma in tow, and always, always wearing mouse ears.</p>\n<p>The fashion is amazing, including the mouse ears. Disney sure has diversified since the 70's. No more black Mickey Mouse ears; now, everyone is bedazzled! Sequins, fur, sparkly bows, and even leopard prints are the rage. And every type of Disney t-shirt imaginable is being worn too. They even combine logos now. I saw Mickey as a New York Yankee, Mickey as a LA Dodger, a Laker and an Anaheim Duck. Oddly, not as a Saskatchewan Roughrider, but I'm still looking.</p>\n<p>Watching the dads and grandpas is my favourite pastime. Dad's tend toward being sun-conscious or sports-conscious. That is, they either have the largest sun hat of the group (sensible and much needed if a little dorky) or are draped head to toe in the colours of their team. I saw all blue Dallas Cowboy fans, including hat, shirt, pants and socks and Cardinals fans who even had red shoes. It's awesome.</p>\n<p>But my favourite beyond all others is the matching family vacation outfits. I saw a family of six wearing bright orange t-shirts with Snoopy silk screened on the front and &quot;Marshall Family Vacation 2016&quot; underneath. Brilliant! Others wore all pink or all yellow or all green. It reminded me of the stag and stagette crews all around Amsterdam, but these folks were off to Disneyland and good for them. Robyn's quite disappointed that we didn't get matching outfits when we did our trips to the Maritimes and Vancouver Island and maybe she has a point.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Go Team Pink!</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>The other vivid memory of my first trip to Anaheim was the food. My dad is a very fussy eater and that intensified on vacation. On our first vacation to Ontario he insisted on only stopping at Husky House truck stops and ordered the same meal every time. This carried on to California.</p>\n<p>I remember walking twice a day, in the morning and evening, south from our motel, alongside the massive Disneyland parking lot, to the southern corner of the park. There, on the corner, was a small family restaurant with the unfortunate name of Sambo's.</p>\n<p>We walked to Sambo's every day for breakfast and every day for supper and Dad ordered the same thing every single time. Bacon, eggs over easy, white toast and coffee for breakfast and hamburger steak, soup and coffee for supper. When our waitress asked Dad if he wanted 'the usual' on Day 3 he beamed. There was no way we were going anywhere else now.</p>\n<p>I took a few circuits around the Disney Resorts looking for Sambo's yesterday but I couldn't find it.

			"content_html": "<p>The travel bug is incurable. Once it's in you, any daily routine that doesn't involve leaving the house early and exploring new surroundings just doesn't cut it. So after 3 weeks of trying to find something new in the city of my birth, I jumped at the chance to cash in some air miles and head for the airport again.</p>\n<p>My favourite daughter Robyn is heading off to VidCon, the annual YouTube conference in Anaheim, California. Her friend and travel companion couldn't afford the trip this year but Robyn was determined to go. She's not really comfortable travelling alone however, so I'm going as a roommate and Chief Transportation Officer. My main role as CTO is convincing her to walk around Anaheim even though it's 30C+ every day.</p>\n<p>Because I booked my flight two days before leaving, I couldn't get the same flight as Robyn. Not the same airline either. Or even the same connecting city. So while Robyn flew to Los Angeles via Calgary, I took the longer route and headed east to Minneapolis. I had the opportunity to go to the airport at 4AM to catch my flight too. Take my word for it, Regina sure is lovely and peaceful at 4AM.</p>\n<p>I still can't get over the difference in how people dress in North America vs. Europe. My frumpy shirt and baggy pants make me the well dressed one here! The plane to Minneapolis was full of ball caps, t-shirts (not always covering bellies) and shorts. There was one guy in his 50's wearing pale khaki short shorts with a black Motley Crüe t-shirt stretched over his belly. At 4AM! But at least he has a black leather bag.</p>\n<p>I got caught up listening to 4 younger folks talking before we boarded. Two are off to Detroit to watch 3 baseball games in 2 1/2 days. Another man (in a suit, by the way) was off to Calgary, while a woman was going to her second house in Phoenix. She was 45 at most. She and her husband sold the house and now they were putting the furniture in storage while they looked for a different house. Flip and grow, I guess. I seem to have chosen a different path. Ah well.</p>\n<p>I can't deal with either fashion / lifestyle extreme, to be honest. The race for stuff and houses to put them in, or the general &quot;I Work On The Rigs&quot; look. I know I'm being an anti prairie-ist, but there were very few people on the plane with whom I felt comfortable striking up a conversation. Maybe I was just tired and missing my partner in travel.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Missing my travel companion. A seat was available too.</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>In Spain, everyone dressed like an architect or an industrial designer. They couldn't all be architects, but still. I'd much rather talk to someone who is well dressed than hope against hope that the Gold's gym gorilla boarding behind me sits down before my row.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, I really love travelling. I even love airports, so long as I have a lot of time. I love wandering around the shopping area, buying an incredibly expensive coffee, and people watching. And you're not going to find a more diverse and eclectic group of people than at a major hub airport in the USA.</p>\n<p>Harried mothers with a bevy of young babes in tow, all eating a messy chocolate donut and then rolling on the ground.</p>\n<p>People of every nationality with fashion proportional to the distance from Minneapolis (the further away, the nicer the clothes.)</p>\n<p>Young sales types, looking dashing and serious and trying to exude success, walking with their middle aged mentors, who still have the dress but have softened significantly around the edges.</p>\n<p>And everyone, I mean everyone, either sleeping, &quot;doing business&quot; on the phone or gazing, deep and unblinking, into the blue glow of their smartphones. If, heaven forbid, one is too poor or too forgetful to bring a phone, all the seats at the gate have tablets for some last minute deep gazing before boarding.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>The gates in Minneapolis have tables with tablets, just in case you forgot your own.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I had a three hour layover in Minneapolis, but when I booked my flights Cindy noticed that the connection home is very tight. I'll have 30 minutes to get from the LA plane to my plane home to Regina and Minneapolis is very large indeed. So I checked arrivals and departures board to get the lay of the land. If the gates are consistent (and these are daily flights so I bet they are) it's going to be a challenge to make my connection. We're talking two opposing wings of the airport.</p>\n<p>Having time to kill, I did a dry run and timed myself from gate to gate. Through a combination of one flight of stairs, moving sidewalks, a tram and speed walking, I made it gate to gate in just over 9 minutes. So if I can get off the plane in 10 minutes, then run like hell with an empty bladder, I should make it before they close the gate with a minute to spare. To be safe, I tried to upgrade my return ticket to sit near the front, but it's not allowed on my Air Miles redemption. I shall have to try over the phone.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Many, many hallways like this between my gate from LA and the one to Regina</p></figcaption></figure> \nI blame my overly polite Canadian-ness for a mistake I made on the second leg of my flight. The flight was full, and the overhead bins were going to be over stuffed, so the gate attendants asked for people to volunteer to check their bags. Since I had two hours to kill at LAX waiting for Robyn's flight to arrive, I volunteered.\n<p>The problem came when I went to collect my bag before finding a place for lunch. Once I arrived at the baggage carousel I realized that I had passed out of the secure area. The secure area was also the area with all the restaurants. A slice of Banana Bread from Starbucks was my lunch and early supper until I hiked across the airport to find Robyn's terminal, she landed, we found a shuttle bus and made our way to our hotel in Anaheim. I made it, but will be packing an apple with me for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>Oh, and just in case I was feeling too cozy as the new Hemingway of the travel scene, ready to run with the bulls or get into the ring to wrestle Mickey Mouse, the young lady at the Starbucks called me sweetie.

Money can only go in so many slots, after all. But the first decision in a new country takes on a ridiculously huge importance. I'll easily blow five euros on the wrong drink on Day 10, but spending a euro too much on the first train is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness for adrenaline. The physical fatigue of a sleepless night is more than balanced by the excitement of a new adventure. On the way out, pure adrenaline goes a long way to getting you where you need to go.</p>\n<p>After the first few days, we're settled in to a new routine. Get up, eat, walk around. Every few days, move on. It's a wonderful, invigorating, sustainable groove.</p>\n<p>However, as soon as our route faces home again, a switch flips in my brain. Living in the present is no longer enough. Thoughts of home and the future flood in and time speeds up.

We're heading out for walks every day, Cindy's putting our house back together and I'm either lining up meetings and visits with people or generally worrying. Back to normal all around.</p>\n<p>But one thing has been happening consistently that is taking a while to get used to again. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who we pass on the street says &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;good morning&quot; to us. Every single person.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday I was walking alone down Argyle Road at 7:30AM, when the only other person on the street passed me with a hearty &quot;Good Morning!&quot; I was shaken awake and found my manners in reply at the last possible moment before I could be classed as rude.</p>\n<p>I've slowly had my manners worked out of me in Europe. Even when we were cycling in Holland and would pass another cyclist, they wouldn't even make eye contact. Not even if we were the first person they passed in 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Way back in March, our host in Evora, Portugal told us about a trip she took to Calgary. She asked if it was our &quot;costume&quot; in Canada to say hello to strangers on the street, because that's what everyone did to her in Calgary. I've been thinking a lot this week about Maria as I get used to our customs again.</p>\n<p>We've also had several people replace &quot;Good Morning&quot; with &quot;Welcome Back&quot; which has been very disconcerting. I mean, when I recognize the person it's one thing, but this morning two men passed us in the park and said &quot;Welcome Back&quot; and I had no idea who they were. But one fellow said he was following this blog so knew we were home.</p>\n<p>As we continued the walk, I muttered something about how I was surprised that people I don't know well were reading this blog. At which point Cindy hit me and said I just needed to stop worrying and keep writing. She does that a lot.</p>\n<p>I started this blog for one person. Our friend Deborah asked if I'd be writing about the trip and I thought it would be fun to send dispatches home. But I never imagined so many people would be following along. Thanks for reading and commenting and emailing and everything else.</p>\n<p>And thanks, Deborah. We'll come visit soon.</p>\n<p>I'll keep writing, here, there and everywhere. I'll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>PS. I just realized Cindy filmed that crazy hand-crank Dutch bike ferry <a href=\"https://markdyck.ca/blog/holland/\">I told you about</a>.

As we waited for our burgers to get grilled up, I sat and watched the cyclists negotiate the T intersection; left to the train station, right to the University, and right then left over the bridge across one of the many canals that striped the city centre. I watched groups of young boys, young women in pairs and alone, old couples, families with two kids in the front. I even saw several riders hauling a friend sitting side saddle on the back rack. One girl straddled the front rack, facing the driver.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Leiden, Netherlands</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>My favourite was a young couple who were clearly on a date.

There are way, way more bikes already parked than there are people in the town. There are racks everywhere. Many are double decker racks too. Rows and rows of them, throughout the town. And at any point in time they are 80% - 90% full, so people just park their bikes in the general vicinity of the racks. Most Dutch bikes have a quick and easy wheel lock that renders the bike useless when locked, so you don't have to actually lock the bike to anything.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>So with all these bikes around us, picturesque towns all close together, and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of smooth paved bike paths around us (over 7000km in the Netherlands as a whole), you'd think it would be easy to rent a bike, right?

Budget Bikes (now there's a warning for you) was open on holiday Monday and had bikes and bags. At least I think they had bikes to rent. It said so on the window. But when we went inside the nice but shockingly dim young men had a really hard time coming up with two bikes to rent. They pulled one out of the back garage, and finally went through their stock of questionable used bikes for the second bikes. The bikes were old and clunky but the chains weren't too rusty so we gave them a go. But they were way too small, no matter how high we raised the seats. After a couple of hours of riding my knees and back were screaming at me as, hunched and dejected, I finally found the bike shop again and gave back the bikes. No way could we ride these for a week.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/b554DX7U8m-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/b554DX7U8m-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>The knee breaker</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>So we explored Leiden on foot.

Especially accommodations. In Leiden, we stayed at a minor hotel so far out of town that it was right on the border of the next town and it was still our most expensive stay so far (it would seem cheap in a week.) It was a good long hike into the city centre, but there was an intercity bus that ran straight past the hotel, along the highway to The Hague, so we caught that if the weather threatened rain.</p>\n<p>In all, we found that things in the Netherlands cost 1.5x to 2x what things cost in Italy, which was already 1.5x the prices in Portugal. Bus and train fare was double. Meals? Double. That 6 euro breakfast for two in Lisbon was 15 euros in Leiden. Lunch ran 20 - 30 euros. And supper? We tried to avoid restaurant suppers when we could, or did our 'two appetizers and a shared main' thing to manage our cash. We were here two weeks and had to make our funds last.</p>\n<p>Accommodations were a challenge throughout. Not just the cost (which was routinely 50% - 100% more than anywhere else bar Paris), but availability. The Netherlands in general, and Holland in particular, is booked. The days of carefree Mediterranean travel, where we booked a room the night before arriving, and paid half or less than our benchmark (the Park Town Hotel in Saskatoon) were over. Now we paid like the Park Town and stayed in the Super 8. But there were a few lucky exceptions.</p>\n<p>Back to these bikes. After the long weekend had passed, we took the bus to The Hague, figuring that the larger city would have a place that rented bikes and bags. But after a day of walking from bike shop to bike shop and finding only one shop that rented bags as well (a hippy run coffee shop whose owner insisted he had 'great bikes' in the basement), we decided to loop back to Amsterdam and go to the first bike shop I'd emailed from Italy. They had bikes, bags, and would store our suitcases while we toured. So the next morning we took the train to Amsterdam, got the bikes, and took them on the train back to Leiden. Then we rode the bikes back to The Hague, experiencing the Netherlands bike route junction network for the first time.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>These are the coolest thing. As I mentioned, there are over 7000km of paved bike lanes all over the Netherlands. The larger paths are part of the junction network, a spider web of paths that connect every town and village in the country. Armed with a map of South Holland, we could trace a path anywhere we wanted to go.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Here's how they work. Every major bike path intersection is given a number. There's a sign at the intersection with the number, plus arrows giving directions to the next junctions. For example, if I'm at junction 70, the sign will say go left to get to #68, right to #53, and keep going straight to #71. So all I have to do to get from Leiden to The Hague, for example, is write down all the junction numbers I need to pass through, in order, then connect the dots as I ride along.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It's not perfect; some of the sign are vague, like when a single arrow points in between my two options at a fork in the road.

It's the seat of government in the Netherlands, (although Amsterdam is the capital; quite different from home) so you've got fine government buildings and lots of attractive, prosperous people on the streets. And there's also a lot of very stunning, unique modern architecture, from the massive, all white City Hall and public library to the funky, new De Resident neighbourhood right beside the historic main square. De Resident is extra cool; they got a different architect to design each apartment building, so each building is unique. But each building also ties into it's surroundings as well.

We spent a delightful afternoon and morning wandering up and down the streets, crossing every bridge and sitting down at as many cafes as we could handle. We found a great mom &amp; pop bakery for coffee and pastries, and also found the square where all the students went for evening coffee.

We were crossing the main square, between the large church at one end and the hall at the other, when a newly married couple left the church and cycled over to the hall, followed by the wedding party and all the guests. All were dressed up, carrying blue and white balloons, and all were riding bikes. The lovely bride was in a cart in front of the lead bike, pedalled by the groom. In the background, the church carillon played wedding melodies while the bride and groom did two loops of the square then led the entire procession into the hall. It was elegant, teary-eye romantic and very, very Dutch.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/M3VizfBMue-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/M3VizfBMue-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/1YK1ff3KvJ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/grXueFXYpa-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/grXueFXYpa-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iu_OwJCXit-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/iu_OwJCXit-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>From Delft we rode on to Rotterdam, one of the largest modern port cities in the world. But you wouldn't know it from the ride; we spent a cloudy and rainy morning cycling through <em>polders</em>, the low fields that are completely surrounded by canals and are actually lower than the larger canals that run along side.

Holy Cow, what a place! Cindy read that at one point the Dutch were concerned that the European Union would outlaw open air markets (as if!) so in typical Dutch fashion they fixed things by building a massive, 10 story tall dome and put the market inside. The ends of the dome are just clear glass, but the sides are 10 floors of apartments and restaurants, that curve around the dome. I still can't get over this structure; I can't even decide if it looks better from the outside or the inside! But the food inside is amazing and the restaurants are very good too.

So as it was now Saturday we checked that out too. Lots of fruit, meat, fish and cheese, along with all the household items and clothes that fill out these markets. I chickened out though and passed by the haring (herring) stand, although I watched a few locals eat the cured fish, smothered in raw onions, in two big bites.</p>\n<p>Across the square from the Markthal is the Rotterdam Public Library, one of the best libraries I've ever been in. Even better than Bologna. Not only are there a ton of books and other media, but there's a pretty good coffee shop too.

It's in a great location, is in an amazing building, and has a ton of places to sit and work. And you know what? It's busy! We could barely find a seat to read and write in the six floors we checked out. I guess if you make a comfortable space to read and work, people will use it.

But the bombs missed Kinderdijk and there are still rows of windmills dating from the 1740's there. We walked along the polders and went inside two windmills to learn more about how they worked and what it was like to live in one.</p>\n<p>The windmill operator lived in the mill permanently, with his family. In one windmill, the operator lived with his wife and thirteen children! It was a tough life and things changed only recently. Windmill operators lived in the windmills up to the 1950's.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Now here's how they work. Remember how I mentioned that the polders are lower than the surrounding land? Well, the windmills help keep the polders from filling back up with water. A row of windmills sits on a narrow strip of land between the polder canals and a higher canal. When the wind blows, the windmill turns a big wheel that literally scoops the water from the lower polder canal and throws it up into the higher canal. Then, another set of windmills throw the water from the higher canal up even higher, into the Lek River.</p>\n<p>That's right, all the land is lower than the level of the river! It's fascinating engineering, but it really brings home how the Dutch have literally built their country. Most of Holland would be a large inland sea if it weren't for all this moving water.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_P-RbfjPjv-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_P-RbfjPjv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Monday morning was rainy, but we had booked rooms up the road, so we bundled up and set out for our next destination, Gouda.

But this was much more than a collection of garden plots. Each plot had a large shed/small cottage that was clearly made for the gardener. A place to hang out as he tended his crops. Many of the plots looked more like small yards than a mere vegetable patch. We wandered around and checked things out and took pictures of the sheds. Hopefully I can build one at home and turn it into a writing studio.

It's the highest bell tower in the Netherlands, even though it's no longer attached to a church! It used to be connected to a very large cathedral, but a large storm in the 1600's destroyed half the church, right in the middle. The Protestants, who ran the church at the time, figured it was a Sign that the church was too gaudy, so left the centre in ruins. Now the centre has been cleaned up and is the delightful Dom Square, an open square between the tower and the remaining church.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-muU08DVOb-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/-muU08DVOb-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>They give guided tours of Dom Tower and we took one. It's very good. The tower is so big that we stopped on three levels to learn about what was going on. Not just up then down like in Siena. The first two levels are private chapels, and the top two levels contain all the bells. Both 14 large bells, of which seven still remain from 1502, and a 40+ bell carillon that can played like a very large organ. The carillon can be played by a musician, but is also connected to a large wheel that plays a melody every 15 minutes. The melodies can be programmed much like a paper reel on a player piano, but with large metal pins and the tune changes over the year. We were told that the new carillon player in town is young and modern and will even play rock tunes on the bells when she has a concert!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tz-NsWFT6E-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/tz-NsWFT6E-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The purpose of this leg of the trip was cycling, so we didn't linger for too long in any one city. But we did get a full day and night in Utrecht, which meant we walked back to the centre that night for a 'Utrecht by night' walking tour. Students have set up light displays throughout the centre that run after sunset (around 9:45pm in May) and there's a walking route to see them all. Some lights are on buildings, some in the trees and others are under bridges along the canals.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>While the light displays aren't too spectacular, the walking loop is a lot of fun. Tiny illuminated arrows are placed in the cobblestone sidewalks every so often, marking the route. They are far enough apart that you really have to look for them, and on quiet, nearly deserted streets in a Medieval town centre, it can get a little spooky. And there was a big payoff at the final point of the tour: the Dom Tower was lit spectacularly, right at the very top of the 95 metre tower. Right at the top of the hour, the lights went out, then the carillon played for a long time as the lights came back on and swirled and danced over the face of the tower.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oh7te8saoX-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/oh7te8saoX-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>For our final ride of our Holland loop, from Utrecht back to the bike shop in Amsterdam, we finally got some sunshine. Eight days of cloud and intermittent showers, plus one day of just plain rain, was making the bike rides a bit of work. But this day the sun was out and the sky was blue (well, blue-ish) as we set off on the bike path. Our route took us away from the highway and even away from farms; today we were in cottage country. We rode along large lakes filled with small yachts and lined by very fine cottages. Some were all out villas. Ahoy, rich folks!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AFYpn_8SUK-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/AFYpn_8SUK-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It was our best ride of the trip, even though it was the longest.

At one point, there was a manual 'bikes only' ferry to get us across the canal! We loaded our bikes on, then turned a crank again and again to pull the ferry across the canal. What fun!

Seeing so many people out enjoying the day shook the gloom off my shoulders.</p>\n<p>Then the good vibes continued as we walked along lovely tree-lined streets, with a canal in the middle and tight, narrow, crooked row houses running the length of the block. We stopped in bakeries, took a good look at what everyone was eating for brunch, and window shopped for shoes and a new suit.</p>\n<p>Finally, we turned the corner and fell in love. We had reached the Museum Quarter, with a gorgeous concert hall at one end, the massive Riksmuseum at the other, and the ultra-modern Van Gogh Museum in the middle. Beside the Van Gogh museum was a huge green space, and behind that, an exceptionally cool open air antique market. And within the market, was the coolest trio of street food vendors ever.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uzaJGgPn2O-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/uzaJGgPn2O-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3OXRioBNM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/H3OXRioBNM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tphW9YxXHK-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/tphW9YxXHK-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Poffertjes, made fresh and served hot.

			"content_html": "<p>I'm from where food is grown. Maybe not all the food I want to eat (I love a good orange), but still. Meat, grains, vegetables. We feed people here.</p>\n<p>So there's a special place in my heart to visit places where the food is grown. And in Italy, it's grown everywhere. But nowhere more than in the Veneto. Our friend and baker Giacomo was from the Veneto and told us so many stories of his homeland that we just had to go check it out.</p>\n<p>Our first stop was Bologna, which is actually a little south of the Veneto, in Emilia-Romangna. It's known as the food capital of Italy, genesis of the entire &quot;Slow Food&quot; movement. It's the home of tortellini, mortadella (aka &quot;baloney&quot; at home), tagliatelle and, of course, bolognese sauce.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>That's all true, but I'll remember Bologna as the City of the Portico. Most all the buildings in the old city centre have porticos on all sides; arched coverings that extend over the terrazzo sidewalks. If it's raining, and country this green must get a lot of it, you can walk all through the centre without getting wet. One portico is over 3km long. Legend has it that it was built to transport a statue of the Virgin Mary between the church and the square; after years of it always raining on festival day, the town fathers built the world's longest portico for a permanent fix.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our apartment in Bologna was one of the best of the trip. A cozy rooftop flat tucked into the top corner of a large block, requiring us to pass through three iron gates and cross two passages with open views of the centre courtyard to get to our door. But inside we had a modern kitchen, a low ceiling sitting room, the most comfortable bed of the trip, and window that opened to the sky above. Even with all the sights in Bologna, I needed two afternoon naps in that cool, breezy bedroom.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Temporary bakery set up in the square beside our flat.

The narrow four block area has been the food hub of Bologna since Roman times and it's still going strong. It's filled with fancy shops selling perfect fruits and vegetables, fresh pasta, cheese, oil, meat and fish. We saw our first butcher specializing in horse meat (a delicacy in northern Italy) although we didn't have the guts to try any.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Read the label!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The food here is the most expensive we had seen in Italy, but it was so fresh, and presented so well, that we didn't have any objections to loading up our shopping bags and cooking this great food in our apartment for two meals. There are also many excellent restaurants in the area, but when the food in the shops is that good, I just have to cook. Bags of fresh tomatoes, garlic and zucchini, plus lovingly wrapped parcels of fresh pasta and wedges of the best parmigiano made their way up to our room. We feasted that week.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It's awesome just how many of what you think of as 'Italian Food' came from around Bologna. Aside from pizza, almost all of it. The city of Parma, home of parmigiano reggiano cheese and Parma ham, is just down the road. Modena, where all the best balsamic vinegar comes from is right there too. What a delight.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The city is beautiful too. We explored it in depth thanks to Robyn's &quot;Walking in Italy&quot; book. Setting aside the miles of porticos for a moment, Bologna also has a huge, interesting main square, anchored with a massive statue of Neptune in the middle (even though the city is far inland.) It also has two huge towers in the city centre, so tall, so narrow and with such drastic leans to them that I was too scared to climb them. Although Cindy braved the climb and took some great pictures to prove it.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/oOqFQ2YGCM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UZTG1N0mGu-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/UZTG1N0mGu-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T25np8mJxQ-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/T25np8mJxQ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1C3EQf8Twa-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/1C3EQf8Twa-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The main square also has the best public library of the trip so far.

Two, because we started off in the wrong direction and found an open 'wilderness' park high on a hill outside the old town. It was nice, but a little too remote for our lazy day plans. So we headed back into town and found the 'city' park very close to our apartment, but in the opposite direction from where we started the trip. That was OK though, because the detour took us past our new favourite lunch Cafe. We dined on sandwiches, wine, with fresh strawberries and ice cream for dessert, all from a high patio beside the street. It was a perfect venue to hang out and watch the world drift by.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/yR3CE72sCy-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/yR3CE72sCy-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>I made two new friends with my paints</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>We left Bologna after stopping at our new favourite gelato shop for breakfast.

And mountains! The start of the Alps, with Gran Paradiso and the Italian Lakes off in hazy blue distance. They'd have to wait, but on a clear day they set off Verona's buildings beautifully.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8IijlqLxfx-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/8IijlqLxfx-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>You may know Verona as the setting for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. There's a bit of recognition here; a balcony with a sign &quot;just like Juliet's&quot; etc. but not too much. What Verona had for us is the Holy Trinity of Awesome European Cities: rivers with lots of bridges; a castle; and a Roman Arena. We spent two wonderful days strolling along the river and trying to figure out the best view of the castle, and touring the local cathedrals. When that got tiring, we'd sit in the town square, sip Spritz (the local specialty) and gaze at the Arena that was smack dab in the middle of the square. It's in good enough shape that the Arena is still used for operas in the summer.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MJMBvlpyBg-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/MJMBvlpyBg-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBH4bIVHAk-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/mBH4bIVHAk-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I don't want to gloss over the beauty of Verona. It's awesome. But by this point we were settled into a gentle Italian groove that was so relaxing and so satisfying that I could keep it going forever. Our toughest decisions were selecting the right gelato shop from fifty options, or whether to dine at a small family run pizza shop or the neighbourhood Osteria (we did both!) We found a lovely square near our apartment, and away from the tourist loop, which had enough bars and restaurants to keep us occupied for a week.

And I learned that I must cheer for Juventus and never Milan.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X91FTrGs6Z-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/X91FTrGs6Z-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vyRIWVDqUp-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/vyRIWVDqUp-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mBeWqOzUEN-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/mBeWqOzUEN-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We could only spend one day together, sadly, because Alessandra had to work and we had to get back to Verona for my special splurge of the trip. I saw a poster that the Hellas Verona football club was playing their final home game of the season on Sunday night, against Serie A champions Juventus no less! Since Juventus had already clinched the title, and Verona was guaranteed to be relegated at season's end, there were still tickets available, and we got two very nice seats in the neutral side of the stadium.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The game was awesome. I've never heard so much noise and singing at a sporting event before. The away fans from Torino were extremely loud, singing praise on their Juventus or abuse at the Verona fans. And then the Verona Ultras would reply and the stadium would shake with their booming songs. Thankfully I don't know enough Italian to understand the words. I assume it was mild, like &quot;Our Team Is A-OK&quot; or &quot;Bad Luck, Visitors&quot; and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Things started off rocky for us until we realized that, even though Verona was the home team, there were many, many people in our section who were there to see the champions Juventus. Lots of families with young boys wearing the black and white stripes of their heroes on the visiting team. So we made sure to cheer everyone and not look too happy when the home team spanked the champs 2-1 to end their season on a high. Verona striker Luca Toni, playing his last game as a pro, took a lap of honour after the game and I cheered along; his was the only name I recognized from the home team, after all.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ltgHMty7l0-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ltgHMty7l0-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Leaving Verona for the second, and final, time on Monday morning, we headed east to Padua.

It's got some amazing architecture, not least is the huge market building that is surrounded by three distinct squares.

It goes well beyond food. So many of the market stalls, up to half in some cases, are for non-food items. Soap, dishes, small appliances. Clothes too. Racks of shirts. Stacks of denim, or socks, or underwear. Mannequins displaying lingerie even. I'm sorry, but I can't do it. I'd try horse meat before I'd buy underwear from a market stall. Or even a new outfit. I'm not ready for that yet. But lots of people are, that's for sure.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/fkbAeHy7Mj-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We were also blessed with one of the very best gelaterias in Italy (better than Bologna?

It's a lovely little place, right in among the residential neighbourhood, with coffee and gelato and croissants and delicious little sweets. After a few attempts with our bad Italian, they figured out why we were so interested in the place, and Paride invited us into the back to watch them work for twenty minutes or so. One of the bakers spoke English so we had a great time comparing equipment, techniques and bakers hours. Paride wanted to know what type of things we made at Orange Boot. He doesn't make bread, and I think he likes the fancy pastries better, but we got along. Especially after I grinned and complemented him on his chocolate tempering machines. I can't see how Orange Boot version 3 can exist without them. And gelato.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/k92ThJSJjd-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/k92ThJSJjd-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We also connected up with Francesco and Nicolo, two friends of Giacomo's who all lived together in London before Giacomo came to Canada and they returned to Padua.

We talked for hours about life in Italy and they asked a ton of questions about life in Canada. They want to come visit soon.

The entire chapel is covered in a cycle of paintings telling the same bible stories about Jesus and Mary that I learned in Sunday School. Except in this case, the paintings were done in 1305! It was stunning. The paintings were in remarkably good condition; I was surprised to learn that any deteriorating has happened in just the last 100 years, as structures surrounding the chapel were torn down. Now water can damage the paintings from the outside in. But I think some of the exorbitant viewing fee is used to pay for restoration work. I hope so; it's an amazing space of art and history, and well worth preserving.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/08FFCT93tK-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/08FFCT93tK-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And then we went to Venice.

Even if you're travelling light, like us, consider checking your bags at the train station, rather than lugging them through town. We only stayed one night in the city, so we put a change of clothes in our backpacks and left the rest at the station overnight. It was much easier finding our hotel without lugging bags up and down the bridge steps and dodging fellow tourists. Watch even one newlywed couple try to get back to the trains, with a chivalrous husband lugging two huge suitcases through the alleys of Venice and you'll forego luggage all together.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iZr2ZntWsv-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/iZr2ZntWsv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Even though Venice is packed with tourists (and it is <em>packed</em>, let me tell you) the vast, vast majority of people head straight to Plaza San Marco and stay there. We went, we walked, and we admired it, but then we left the square and wandered to the edges. It was pretty much empty out there but no less interesting. There are just as many shops, and amazing contemporary art, and excellent coffee, and food too. And you can walk a bit in peace.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Dead end!</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>Then in the evening, after the busses have gone back to Mestre for the night, we went back to the square and really took it all in. It's wild. Really, the best formal square of the trip, and we've seen a few. It's just really weighty, heavy and perfectly proportioned, from the clock tower that is huge and solid, to the St. Mark's Basilica, that is big and gorgeous and shiny and gold in the evening light, to the three rows of buildings and continuous porticos that make up the square, but run at odd angles, so the square really isn't. It's awesome. It's heavy enough to be very, very impressive. It's so heavy, in fact, and so close to the Grand Canal, that you really do get the impression that Venice is sinking. I mean, you pile that much stone on a spot and it's bound to sink a little, right?</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>For our last night in Venice, our last night in Italy in fact, we took it slow. A nice meal of chicken and vegetables and pasta, sharing a table with two delightful Dutch ladies. A gondola ride that went right past our hotel. A stroll along the Grand Canal and past the opera house. Then off to sleep in our romantic old 6 room hotel deep in the Venetian maze.

My mood is the same grey-blue that is all over Venice at dusk. Dusk is the time that you feel the age of the place.</p>\n<p>Venice feels old. Really old, and tired. More tired than anywhere we've been. It's carried the weight of its citizens for hundreds of years, and now carries the weight of the hoards of tourists. One news agent had a sign saying &quot;Venice Is Not A Theme Park&quot; but honestly, with so many tourists coming through every day, even in this 'shoulder season', it kind of is. There isn't a single business on street level that isn't focused on the tourist trade, and I was looking.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And that's the thing about Italy. The place really pulls at you. We came here as tourists and we're leaving as tourists too, I guess. But it's just so damn comfortable. Sure there' street history and architecture, I wasn't here long before I started acting like I lived here. Where's the hardware store? Where can I buy a toaster? Where's the bike repair shop?</p>\n<p>I'd live and work here in a minute, if I could. Give me a coffee bar, a fruit stand, a gelateria and an Internet connection and I wouldn't leave my block. <em>&quot;Buongiorno. Il mio nome è Marco. Sì, l'Italia è bella . Vieni a sederti.

			"content_html": "<p>After the hot cliffs and beaches and clear blue skies of the Cinque Terre, we headed inland toward Tuscany. Our first stop was Lucca, a hot tip from our bakery friend Elanna. It's well worth checking out.</p>\n<p>The train ride to Lucca was short but full of interest. We passed through Cararra, home of the marble made famous (to us) by Sarah Richardson and all her decorating shows. An episode isn't complete until Sarah picks out a slab of Cararra for a countertop or backsplash. Well, it all comes from a single mountain outside this town. We passed the white marble mountain, then through the town with work yards full of marble. Huge blocks that could be used on the Pyramids and row after row of thin slabs, ready for a kitchen or bathroom in Harbour Landing.</p>\n<p>Then we turned inland, through tall green hills with villages wedged in between the slopes and gardens and fields in the valleys. The land was green, fertile and full of life.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Lucca itself is unique in that it has an intact city wall, surrounded by a green space and even a moat (ok, a canal) in places. The wall was designed by Leonardo da Vinci, no less, and has never been breached. From the train station outside the walls you need to find a gate through the walls to get into the old town. But the best part is the top of the walls is a long, wide, wonderful walking / running path and park. You can walk around the entire town on top of the wall, and many, many people do.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Inside the wall is an old medieval village with black slate, twisting cobblestone streets. The only change seems to be the replacement of blacksmiths with gelaterias. A stone lined canal runs through one corner of the town and feeds several public fountains.

In fact, I bet the number of cyclists outnumber the cars. Our first afternoon in town we had lunch at a tiny cafeteria and watched bike after bike pull up and park at a church next door. After the 30th young woman or man rode up and parked we figured there was something going on. Something stylish because all the cyclists were very well dressed; more for a concert than a workout. Finally we realized that they were all picking up kids from the school beside the church. One by one the parents or grandparents came out of the school with a child in tow. Some kids walked beside mom's bike, some rode on a rack in the front or the back (or both!). Some came over to the cafeteria for coffee and a cookie. It was the closest thing to when the daycare let out beside our bakery, but with bikes and it was awesome.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zMNO-bZvA1-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/zMNO-bZvA1-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/emyGH8pFqA-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/emyGH8pFqA-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xs1e3PI9az-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/xs1e3PI9az-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>But there are still cars, and with all the cars, all the bikes and the complete lack of sidewalks, walking around could get treacherous.

There's as many versions as there are bakers.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dFSyanGn8d-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/dFSyanGn8d-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mA67nDUTBV-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/mA67nDUTBV-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We wandered all around Lucca, through the town and up on the walls. Cindy's book of walking tours gave us some nice routes so we didn't miss a square or a church. We even paid to walk up a tower in the middle of town to see the whole town and surrounding countryside. It was beautiful. Brown-red buildings surrounded by green trees and rolling hills.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CgmRV_0_w6-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/CgmRV_0_w6-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ams-kqrPQ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/8ams-kqrPQ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We had so much fun in Lucca that we decided to stay an extra day, in order to see their Saturday market, even though our apartment was spoken for. So we booked a room in a pension for one night and moved 300 metres to new digs.</p>\n<p>Big mistake. That particular Saturday was a washout. As in, massive Noah style rains. The walk to our room was only three blocks but we were completely drenched. Rather than go to the market (which was cancelled anyway) we hung all our clothes to dry and, after a delicious pizza lunch, stuffed newspapers in our shoes and hoped they'd dry in our cold, damp room. Cindy's shoes were dry enough to head out for a much needed haircut, and learned that her new favourite stylist has a cousin in Regina. No kidding! We have someone new to call when we get home now.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bYknws_-i7-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/bYknws_-i7-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/j4xRFD6VaI-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/j4xRFD6VaI-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Damp but undefeated, we left Lucca on Sunday morning on the train for Pisa. Even without the Leaning Tower, Pisa is an interesting city. It was an ancient maritime powerhouse that collected many riches via trading and menaced the surrounding towns. Many of the castles we visited in the area were fortified to protect the citizenry from attacks from Pisa.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4qoltZBWkv-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/4qoltZBWkv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We checked our bags at the train station and strolled around Pisa, once again following a route from Robyn's excellent &quot;Walks in Italy&quot; book. We walked up to the main square the Campo de Miracoli, and saw the famous Leaning Tower and the Cathedral beside it. All the white marble buildings in the square shone against the bright green grass of the square. It was cloudy outside, but I could imagine how the buildings would stand out against a bright blue sky too.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Ql1x_WXCi6-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I soon got freaked out by the crowds of people in the square, though. It was jammed with people all doing the same thing - posing for pictures. Either selfies with those infernal sticks or three thousand people doing the exact same &quot;hold up the tower&quot; pose. This often required the camera person to sit on the ground, across the sidewalk from the poser, to get the angle just right. And boy did they get mad when you walked in front of them! At least the first 500 people did. Then I walked behind the posers to photobomb as many selfie shooters as I could before Cindy got mad at me and we left the square. Well, really.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/o6wo48gxZR-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/o6wo48gxZR-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Q2WkU1EPAk-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The rest of Pisa outside of Campo dei Miracoli was pretty much deserted, so we had a delightful afternoon following the route in Robyn's book. We walked up the Arno River, then crossed the bridge and walked down it. We went through Girabali square for gelato. And we found a delightful little park surrounded by restaurants for lunch. We actually went in one block to a tiny pizza restaurant where we were the only English speakers in the place. Only long tables of locals out for Sunday lunch, chowing down on pizza or these immense focaccia sandwiches, that were as big around as a pizza but three times as thick.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sPgRdjPp74-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/sPgRdjPp74-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/nJUy2c4qIT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/nJUy2c4qIT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dNL8YJYYT1-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/dNL8YJYYT1-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Full and footsore, we walked back to Pisa Centrale station, collected our bags, and hopped on our train to Florence.

Best hard sell leather bag (150 euros, still too much) from the same block of stalls. And the best loaf of bread on the trip, bar none, from Pank, upstairs at the central market.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0A7aidfYtl-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/0A7aidfYtl-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The upstairs of the market is very interesting. It's been turned into an upstairs food court, but from what I could tell, they are all connected. Sort of a big food family. I know I poo-pooed a similar setup in my Lisbon post, but at least this was a complement to a real market, not a replacement. And it had a real, proper bakery.</p>\n<p>We bought a ciabatta loaf which looked nothing like any ciabatta I'd ever seen. It was baked really dark and looked more like a flat loaf of bread rather than a flatbread, if you follow me. The bakery was open for viewing so Cindy and I sat for an hour on high stools in front of the oven and watched the baker do his thing, baking off deck after deck of long pizza breads that were baked with tomato sauce, then topped by the sandwich prep baker and baked again before serving. Everything from the bread, to the baker, to the counter staff was awesome. They were all pros, 100%. We ate an excellent apricot tart and watched everyone work like a well oiled machine, like Orange Boot on our best days, then told them how great they were and headed out. Later on, when we ate the ciabatta on a church bench, we wished we'd bought more.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MoiaYmC9MY-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/MoiaYmC9MY-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>On our last day in Florence we caught a bus to Fiesole, a hill town just outside of the city. It had amazing views of the entire city as well as the valley around Florence, but the highlight of the day was the extensive Estruscan and Roman ruins. We walked for an hour around the excavated baths and temples before having lunch sitting in the Roman theatre, which is in good enough shape that they still hold concerts there in the summer. Then we walked through a really excellent museum where they displayed Estruscan, Roman and Longobard (ie, Lombards, the Germanic folks who came after the Romans) artifacts that have been found at the site and around Fiesole. This included several Longobard tombs which were exhumed and moved to the museum intact. A little creepy but extremely interesting.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/lhaQ3GVzfa-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0zDebePDNl-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/0zDebePDNl-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/F7qiZkL_Ac-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FyzIN25CR8-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/FyzIN25CR8-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>From Florence we moved on to San Gimignano, a small medieval hill town in the heart of Tuscany, where I am writing this now. It took a little doing to get here - a train to Poggibonsi, 11km away, then a somewhat harrowing bus ride up the hill to the gates of the old town. But from the moment we got off the bus we've been in love.

We followed a meandering route along a ridge line through the hamlet of Pasole before finally descending down to Certaldo. It was a gorgeous walk till we hit the town; the final kilometre or so was along a busy highway. Then we rode a very cool funicular up to the old townsite for gelato and more exquisite views. Then we hopped the train to Poggibonsi and the bus back to San Gimignano, before heading off for our best meal of the trip. We had a lovely traditional Tuscan meal of charcuterie, pasta, Vernaccia wine and dessert on a patio overlooking the valley we walked through earlier in the day. It was a big splurge for us, but oh so worth it.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t41sa1TRQa-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/t41sa1TRQa-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our second walk, on May Day, was intended to take on a loop past the hill town of Ulignano. It started off brilliantly, descending down through a forest of poplars and pine trees, past acres of vineyards and the winery itself. But then the route branched off to a dirt trail that was described as 'treacherous when wet.' And it sure was. The road was all mud from a big overnight rain, and the soil was heavy clay like back home, the kind that would suck off your rubber boot on the school playground. We tried our best but abandoned the trail before we hit the bottom of the valley; better that than to lose our shoes.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JxrL0zMzZd-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/JxrL0zMzZd-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Bees!

Too much traffic on the narrow highway was No Fun, so we retraced our steps through the forest and climbed back up to San Gimignano. I think we walked twice through the best part of the hike anyway, so it was all good. We even saw two tours of horseback riders and two crazy mountain bikers, who were descending the hill we were climbing as fast as they could. It must've been fun, because one biker rode back up the long, steep, gravel road and screamed past us a second time.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QipGiE2rbT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/QipGiE2rbT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QTpz7htjk5-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/QTpz7htjk5-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>On Saturday, in between our two hikes, we hopped on the bus and took a day trip to Siena.

They were competing with Florence to see who could have the best art and the most ornate cathedrals. (San Gimignano, by comparison, took the more literal approach and tried to build the most and tallest towers.) Siena did a pretty good job, I must say.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/gmi33PsA2G-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/gmi33PsA2G-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Bv0Zvh1Rig-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>But the best structure for me was the soccer stadium just outside the old town and right beside the bus station.

We had a final amazing meal in Tuscany, more meats, more pasta, and a roast rabbit with a sauce containing chocolate and wine. Delicious! A perfect end to a perfect stay in Tuscany.</p>\n<p>A while back, Cindy's mom said she was worried that we'd find a place that was so beautiful that we would just pull up stakes and move there. Well you could do worse than Tuscany, that's for sure. I'd need to make new money to get there, but it sure is a worthy goal. The views, the climate, the food and the wine are simply wonderful.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ExrFmq7BIl-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ExrFmq7BIl-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And the crazy thing?

			"content_html": "<p>I'm sitting outside, in glorious sunshine, on a 50 metre long iron bench at the La Spezia Centrale station on the Ligurian coast. La Spezia is known as the Gulf of Poets, because back in the gloomy 18th century English poets like Byron, Shelley and Dickenson traveled south to get away from rainy England and swim a bit. I can see why they came. It wasn't raining much in Paris, and it's not like I'll ever feel the need to &quot;get away&quot; from Paris, but still. It sure wasn't warm and sunny and blue like this.</p>\n<p>We didn't come straight here. Instead, from Paris we went south to Nice on the French Riviera. Beautiful city and you really should go if you have the chance. But since Nice is the big city near Cannes, St. Tropez, Cap Ferrat and Monaco, it's a little glitzy and glamourous. Which is all good, but a little awkward when you've been wearing the same clothes for six weeks in a row.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>What Nice has going for it is fabulous architecture, a narrow and twisty old town, a cool tram system that cuts silently through town, two amazing outdoor markets and outstanding gelato (go to Fennochio's in the old town.)</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We spent a few days chilling out in Nice, walking to a market to get strawberries, oranges, fresh peas, a baguette and some cheese for lunch before wandering around the city for the day.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_iiX_iUxyk-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_iiX_iUxyk-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tPjmlpptrT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/tPjmlpptrT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/I3mOmb9dPw-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/I3mOmb9dPw-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Before long we'd be down at the beach, wandering along the miles long promenade, checking out the people roasting themselves on the beach and trying to stay calm among men in tiny speedos and women sunbathing topless. Sure, the tiniest speedos were worn by old hairy grandpas, and the topless sunbathers were grannies for the most part, but we were in France, on the Riviera! Just go with it, man. Time to get over the years of body image conditioning we grow up with in North America and live like a local! Well I would've stripped right down to my gitch for the cultural exchange, you know, if it weren't that I sunburn easily. So I took off my socks and rolled up my pant legs to just below the knee, and strolled along the water for a bit, averting my eyes all the while.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Now here's a marketing lesson for you all.

But I misread the map and instead of a 2km loop I went to a further hill, 3.5km away and much taller. We walked forever, up and up. At one point we counted a run of 285 steps when the road got too steep for cars. But the views from the top, both of the teenagers making out and the surrounding hills, coast, villas and yachts, were worth it. And we already had a wood fired pizza restaurant at the bottom of the hill picked out for dinner. Pizza, salad and a half litre of the local grape and we'd forgotten all about the climb up. All that was left was the amazing view.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And so, on to Italy. Our train to La Spezia required two changes, and we were late for both of them. But Italian trains are more relaxed on Sunday, it seems, so the trains were both waiting for us. One of my minor stresses with AirBnb apartments is keeping our host waiting for the check-in, so I was glad to get there close to our planned time.</p>\n<p>(And a big highlight was sitting amongst some very, very posh folks on the train between Nice and Monte Carlo. The fellow across from me was either a Swiss banker or Benedict Cumberbatch.)</p>\n<p>Our first impression of Italy is one of relaxed joy. First off, it's beautiful here. La Spezia is nestled in the centre of a U shaped bay, with small mountains all around. The dark green of the trees behind, the bright, azure blue of the water in front, with colourful pink, yellow and cream buildings in the middle. Wow.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And the food is everything we'd imagined. Simple, fresh and cheap. In France, the food is excellent, but you pay a big premium for those perfect French peas or local strawberries that are placed oh so perfectly in the baskets. Here, the markets are still full to overflowing with tomatoes, peas, strawberries and the cutest baby zucchini, but you just grab a bag and dig in. And the price is at least 30% cheaper than just around the bay in France.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/d9iwRxWO3X-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/d9iwRxWO3X-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We stayed in a modern apartment on the other side of the train station from downtown. It was lovely, because we got a tiny chance to live like a local. The block around our apartment had everything we needed, really. A two person, hole in the wall, wood fired pizza place that sold so much of the local specialty, farinata (a thin omelette made of chickpea flour,) that they could hardly fit pizzas in the oven. A gelato shop that sold trays of ice cream to take home. A butcher/deli, a bakery/coffee shop, a specialty food shop, a fruit stand, a florist, a pharmacy and a Coop. We could pull together a picnic lunch, go adventuring, and come back for pizza for supper. It took us two days before we thought to look for a central market; they have one, and it's glorious too.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jfflkPFKeQ-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/jfflkPFKeQ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>La Spezia is the gateway to the five villages of the Cinque Terre, made famous in North America by Rick Steves and his travel shows. There's stress on these former fishing villages due the crush of tourism, but that's how we heard of the Cinque Terre so I'm not going to over think this. It's beautiful, we're in the area, and we'll try to tread lightly. So we hopped a train to the third village of Corniglia.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Back before modern tourism hit the Cinque Terre, the villages were quite isolated. They were only accessible from the sea or via a narrow and winding trail that connected all five villages.

But that still left us half the trails to walk. Once we got up to Corniglia, that is. From the train station at sea level there was a huge set of steps up to the village. Forgoing the shuttle bus, we walked the 310 steps to the village. It's getting easier and easier to climb like this, I must say.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7n48MIw5md-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/7n48MIw5md-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>When we reached the cliff top and strolled into Corniglia I didn't want to leave. Ever. In a trip where we've seen over a dozen of picturesque little towns, this was the new #1. The village square was full of little shops selling fruit, general store type supplies and postal services. Across the square were bars, coffee shops and restaurants tempting me inside. Narrow side streets house artisans selling wine, leather goods and paintings. There was even a gelato shop with a framed picture of Rick Steves himself.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9hs9g-LDuc-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/9hs9g-LDuc-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>After an hour of wandering around the village, Cindy reminded me we were there to hike, so we set off northeast toward Vernazza. It wasn't long before we started to climb, and boy did we ever climb! The path turned into steps, then the steps turned into bare rocks. I really had to focus on each step while we scrambled up and up.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>That's another thing the guidebooks don't really mention. This is a proper hike, not a gentle stroll through the countryside. While the trail is well marked with red and white blazes, it's not a groomed trail as such. The path is strewn with rocks and loose gravel and can get really narrow at points, so hikers travelling in opposite directions need to take turns on the trail. But every time I'd feel like the hike was getting too hard, we'd come up to a viewpoint that took my breath away. We were perched on the ridge like eagles, high above the villages, so we could see Corniglia and Manarola behind us, and Monterosso far off in the distance ahead. And if we looked down, we'd see fishing boats and ferries out on the water. It was magnificent and completely worth the hard work of hiking up to these viewpoints.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2LEfnU3ecv-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2LEfnU3ecv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>After an hour of hard hiking, we came across a cluster of buildings, including a small bar.

I can't imagine what it's like here in July and August; it was crowded enough for me in mid-April. Quite the change from morning in Corniglia. We ate our picnic lunch beside the marina, climbed to the top of the castle overlooking the harbour, and found the trail to Monterosso.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Now, Vernazza is on the water. Monterosso is also on the water. So you'd think a trail between the two villages would also be along the water, right? But oh no. The trail is high, high, up on a ridgeline along the mountain that sits between the two villages. So up we climbed. Up, up, up until my heart was pounding and the afternoon sun was baking my eyebrows. It was a real lung buster, but worth it. The views were amazing once again.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_JQwytkc9S-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_JQwytkc9S-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>This leg of the trail is much narrower than Cornigla -- Vernazza leg, and the trail was more crowded too, so it was a stop/start hike as we paused to let southbound traffic pass.

It was like the steps in the Mines of Moria in the Lord of the Rings. They just went on and on. But at least they were steps! The southbound hikers had to deal with the rock ledges we climbed to get out of Vernazza.

It was beautiful and once we found the market we went every day, even though it was a 30 minute walk from our apartment.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/9ZB8ibOlwD-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I love our Farmer's Market at home (heck, I took bread to the market for two years at the same time I was trying to build Orange Boot), but compared to what we see in Europe, from the largest city to the smallest town, our market in Regina sucks.

Really busy. Busier than the number of people who live and work around it.

They shop every day and eat fresh food and I love that.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Ro6QXQKAPu-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Anyway, once we had our packs full of picnic fare, we got on the bus too and headed to the town of Lereci. If the Gulf of Poets is a U, and La Spezia is at the base of the U, then Lereci is at the end of the left arm. Our host Alice recommended the beach there, and after our massive hike yesterday I was in the mood for a mellow afternoon.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The bus ride out was a blast. We got the last two seats at the back of the bus, just before the bus was jam packed with university students. And I mean packed. They just kept getting on, handing their packs to four young ladies in the seat in front of us, then started hugging each other to save space. I've never seen such a crush. For the longest time, nobody got off the bus, but four more people got on at each stop. More students. An old lady with bags of shopping. Some construction workers. I have no idea how they fit or where they went. But one by one, over the next 20 minutes, the bus would stop, someone would hand over a backpack from the pile, and the bus slowly thinned out. Then it was our turn.</p>\n<p>Lereci is beautiful. A lovely horseshoe cove with a castle at one end, a marina, and a long, curving, sandy beach that went all the way to San Terenzo, the next village on the way back to La Spezia.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We walked to the top of the castle (gotta climb a little!) and gazed out across the Gulf to La Spezia in the distance, and Porto Venere at the other end of the U. It was beautiful but also very windy. I wanted to sketch and paint up there but I couldn't control my sketchbook in the wind, so we retreated down to the marina and checked out the shops lining the quay.

The local flavour, called Lereci, of course, ticks all the boxes. Coffee, nuts, caramel, chocolate all swirled around in some basic crema gelato. Amazing. Until this point my favourite was pistachio (made with real pistachios of course) but now I'm ruined. Hopefully some other local flavour will win my heart down the road, but I'm not holding out much hope.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/inLkIPoxUc-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/inLkIPoxUc-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>On our last day in La Spezia, we took the bus to the other end of the U, to Porto Venere. Another spectacular fishing village with a lovely marina, two churches and even a castle on the hill. Porto Venere is really tucked in there tight between the water and the cliffs, so that getting past the first row of houses required some serious climbing. But there were spectacular views around every corner, so we kept on climbing and being wowed.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/dIR3Np7oJ1-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It was getting on in the afternoon, but we weren't ready to leave the Cinque Terre yet. Cindy had read about a big hike from Porto Venere to the first Cinque Terre village, Riamaggiore. 12km, 4 hours and listed as &quot;moderate&quot; difficulty. The same book said the hikes we did two days ago were &quot;easy-moderate.&quot; Hmmm. Well it was a nice day, we felt good and it was at least 5 hours till sunset, so we decided to go for it. We'd abandon our return bus tickets, do the hike and catch the train back to town from Riomaggiore.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Well it was the best hike I've ever done. Way harder than I imagined; we climbed 500m pretty much straight up, then followed the ridge line around two separate mountains, before descending through vineyards and farms to the village at Riomaggiore. As we twisted up the mountains, through forests, then out on bare rock ledges, then back into forests, we had these wild views of Porto Venere, then La Spezia and Lereci across the Gulf to our right, then the wider Mediterranean off our left shoulder, then finally Riamaggiore below us.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-qPY4JfxqP-400.avif 400w,

			"content_html": "<p>Hi. I'm writing this from the smallest studio apartment I've ever stayed in. We figure it's 200 square feet, including the bathroom. Smaller than most people's bedrooms, I bet. But it's in the Montparnasse neighbourhood in Paris and we've never been happier. The power was out for 14 hours last night (just in our apartment). Didn't care. We just went out and when we got back, lit some candles.</p>\n<p>The last long story I wrote was about our week in Madrid. I'll get back to those longer stories, but here's a quick update.</p>\n<p>We took the train to Barcelona, which is the coolest city every. My favourite on the trip so far. We went out for tapas with our new friends Gillian and Brian (Gillian is the daughter of our friend Laverne) and had a great time. Then Cindy and I walked all over the place, from the Park Gaudi, through the Gracia neighbourhood and to the beach. Then we did it all over again.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/qfXSZl-mHj-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qfXSZl-mHj-700.avif 700w,

Then you realized we were passing things at a very great speed.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>These plains in Spain are quite beautiful. I remember hearing somewhere they get lots of precipitation and it shows. Lots of trees dotting green pastures, with sheep and goats and later, cows. Quite honestly, it was a lot like the plains at home, except for the rocky outcroppings that dotted the landscape. And then the train slowed, we rolled past industrial areas, then apartment blocks, then we were in Madrid. We went from the train to the metro, got off at the Bilbao station and found our hotel.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WZWdhbS1m5-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/WZWdhbS1m5-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-aside\" tabindex=\"-1\">A Brief Aside... <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://markdyck.ca/blog/madrid-the-trains-in-spain-go-hurtling-cross-the-plain/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You know, all these cities are old and romantic and beautiful. But like all cities it seems, they continue to grow, and there isn't the investment in aesthetics anymore. We passed mile after mile of the same ugly, tiny windowed, balcony-less brick apartment blocks on the way into Madrid and they looked like a sad and dreary place to live. Compared to the centre of Madrid, it was shockingly horrible.</p>\n<p>As late as the 1920's, Madrid was still doing strong city planning, as witnessed in the glorious Grand Via. But that seems to have stopped in current times, outside of the centre of the city. Which is a shame. And totally consistent with home, although it doesn't feel like we do much planning in the centre at home either. But the centre of Madrid is glorious, so let's go back there now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-the-story\" tabindex=\"-1\">Back to the story <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://markdyck.ca/blog/madrid-the-trains-in-spain-go-hurtling-cross-the-plain/\">#</a></h2>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/5CIRYJw_Iw-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GWHfdFLeUf-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/GWHfdFLeUf-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our pension for the next five nights was the Pension Antonio, on Calle de la Palma. It was tiny and spare but quiet and clean and centrally located, between the Royal Palace to the east and the Prado Museum to the west, with lots of bars and restaurants and stores in between. It was just fine and cheap enough to recommend to others, although be warned that the last two blocks to the apartment feel pretty sketchy to walk down. But that's just the prairie boy in me reacting to the corrugated steel grates in front of the closed shops and the excessive, monotonous, ugly graffiti. I like Banksy and all, and some businesses pre-empted things by hiring an artist to spray paint their doors in advance, but holy crap it's just endless here.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/5Kk3kD9oeU-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>One of the good ones!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I think the biggest thing that hit me about Madrid is that we were in a really big city. Really big. I looked it up and Madrid's population is 3.5 million people, which makes the largest city we've been to by far. You could tell the difference. No narrow, winding streets here. Instead we had long, grand boulevards, with six lanes of cars and huge fountains and statues in the roundabouts. And masses, and masses of people. Even when we were out looking for something to eat at 9PM, the sidewalks were packed with people doing the same thing.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/93s_M1DMox-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/93s_M1DMox-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We were in Madrid for Easter Weekend, which meant that some of the stores were open irregular hours, but most all of the bars and restaurants were open. And boy oh boy are there ever a lot of bars and restaurants! I've never seen so many places packed that tightly before. Every single street was packed with places big and small. We found a really good sandwich shop on Calle Pez and a gourmet pizza place nearer Bilbao station and lots of bakeries and fruit stands to keep our backpacks stocked up. But there were more than enough people to keep them all going.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39lm9x6XQF-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/39lm9x6XQF-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Too fancy for us.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RAfBdgdkWM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/RAfBdgdkWM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Mmmm...that's more like it!</p></figcaption></figure> \n<p>The long weekend and fine weather meant everyone was out enjoying their time off, so we loaded up our backpacks and joined the fray.

We hiked east from our room, behind the Prado Museum and the National Library to Paque de El Retiro. This huge space is where thousands upon thousands of Madrilenos go on their days off and this war, sunny spring day was no exception. We started at the formal north end of the park, with formal gardens and a large man-made lake. There were dozens of rowboats on the lake and a very long line of people waiting to rent one. We walked around to the east side and watched the boats from a large plaza, complete with lion statues looking over the boaters.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\"

We were at the side door, and it wasn't long before our line bumped into an even longer line for the main door. There must've been 2000 people in all, at least. It was huge!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kUTgfpdtao-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/kUTgfpdtao-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/bFlDxwqVDQ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>But the thing is, the Prado is even huger, and we all fit in with no problem and, aside from the 'big 3' paintings, there wasn't even a crowd. Sorry, no pictures were allowed, but it really was a fun time. We had a New York Times article outlining the preferred order to see the museum's highlights, which we followed and really felt like experts. My favourite paintings were by the Dutch Masters - we went through that gallery twice.</p>\n<p>The other big gallery, the Reina Sofia, is focused on Cubist and Surrealist paintings by the likes of Picasso, Dali and Joan Miro. But I was there for one painting: Picasso's masterpiece &quot;Guernica&quot;. It's fair to say that &quot;Guernica&quot; is the reason I wanted to go to Madrid. It's a massive painting, a protest painting for the bombing of women and children during the Spanish Civil War and I am so very happy I got to see it live and in person. It was even better than I thought it would be. (Although, I was very surprised that I didn't enjoy the Dalis more.)</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BbnRoJG9Ge-400.avif 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BbnRoJG9Ge-400.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BbnRoJG9Ge-400.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/BbnRoJG9Ge-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"179\" alt=\"photo of Picasso's painting Guernica\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>A picture of Guernica, via the Internet. Photos aren't allowed in the gallery!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>I'm embarrassed to say I don't know much about the Spanish Civil War, other than Franco won, the Germans tested their arms in Spain prior to invading Poland, and Hemingway was there. The &quot;Guernica&quot; gallery helped me learn a bit more about it. The painting was commissioned by the Republican (in power, but lost the war) government for the 1939 World Expo, to help raise awareness of what was happening in Spain, and hopefully get some assistance. In the gallery, there was a replica of the pavilion where the painting was first shown, along with posters of the time and other reflections on the costs of war.</p>\n<p>There was also a very interesting display showing Picasso's progression as he worked on the painting. His partner at the time was a photographer and she took a series of shots of this massive mural during its development. There was also a room full of 'post script' paintings where Picasso continued to develop the themes within the painting. Fascinating stuff.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/LQ0LqJVR0M-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Atocha train station</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Between parks, art galleries, the classic Atocha train station and strolling down wide boulevards admiring the architecture, we had a wonderful few days in Madrid. We found a tiny square near our room which we adopted as 'our square', since it had the perfect combination of restaurants, ice cream, coffee, newsstands and bookshops. It even had an art supply store! So it seemed like we ended up at our square at least once per day, at least to end our day with coffee and hot chocolate.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a658wtksUX-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/a658wtksUX-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Easter Sunday was a big thrill for me. Before we left Cindy told me about the Sunday stamp market in Plaza Mayor so even though it was Easter we decided to see if it was on. And boy was it ever!</p>\n<p>Plaza Mayor is the classic town square of Madrid. It's completely enclosed by four connected banks of buildings but the open square inside is huge and holds thousands of people. Usually the square is full of tables from the surrounding restaurants, and they were still there. But on Sunday's there are also 50 or so tables full of stamp, coin, postcard and bottle cap dealers out selling their wares. And since it was Easter Sunday, there were also a few thousand people in the middle of the square watching the final Easter procession of the season. All drummers putting on a show. So the square was loud and boisterous and I loved it.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/7kDrib0EIy-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/7kDrib0EIy-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I spent an hour wandering around the tables, regretting I didn't collect Spanish stamps.

Toledo is a beautiful old walled city, perched high on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding valley, just 70km from Madrid. We were there in 30 minutes by train and had a wonderful afternoon climbing the hill and once again wandering through narrow, twisting streets.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\"

And then, because we had time, we hiked back up to the city, up the incredibly steep stone staircase that passed through the walls, for some gelato before walking back down and across the river to the train station.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g57KScJzCo-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/g57KScJzCo-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/n1r9wPpOg--1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/n1r9wPpOg--400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ui5UhQNeGy-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ui5UhQNeGy-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HNbsKjjoti-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/HNbsKjjoti-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/EQ5kQIcloc-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/EQ5kQIcloc-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>We had tickets on our traditional noon bus northwest to Córdoba, but first we had to get out of Granada. On our walk yesterday, we walked west, away from downtown, and away from the tourist area, into a regular neighbourhood. There we found a delightful neighbourhood pastelaria, with great coffee, a bin full of oranges for juice and pan integral (whole wheat bread) for toast. Now all we had to do is find it again.</p>\n<p>Technology is a double edged sword. That little black box in my pocket, playfully named Big Black Olaf, is crucial for finding our way around the narrow, twisting streets of medieval European cities. Paper maps just don't cut it; the streets are smaller than the names, making them impossible to label properly. But Big Black Olaf, along with the maps.me app, can get me anywhere, and can get me back there again. But only if I pin the destination.</p>\n<p>And that's where the trouble began. We had such a delightful time yesterday, but I forgot to pin the location on the map. So this morning, all we knew is that it was &quot;west&quot; and about a kilometre from our apartment. Past that big fountain with the plaza running &quot;south&quot;, but before the large park with the running track and old men playing bocce.</p>\n<p>But was it before, or after, the university residences with raised gardens full of rosemary and walls full of political graffiti? What about the roundabout with tapas bars we were at last night? Surely it's not that far away!</p>\n<p>So we walked, and walked, and squabbled a little. When we tried to piece together our walk from the day before, we came up with two completely different orders. And I'll admit to you, like I admitted to Cindy on the day, that I'm not at my best without my morning coffee. So I caused a scene and we had a spat and then we looked up and there it was, across the street. Argh. I got my coffee and Cindy got her juice and we bought make up toast and four make up sandwiches for the bus ride and then quietly walked back to the room to get our bags and get on the bus for the bus depot.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HcSr1zSFV--1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/HcSr1zSFV--400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The ride to Córdoba was smooth and pleasant, helped along by the sandwiches and Spanish Gravol. Outside, the landscape was beautiful. As we came out of the mountains, the miles and miles and miles of olive orchards gave way to gently rolling hills and wheat fields. Wheat fields! It was a sunny day and the wheat was already well along, creating a bright green carpet that popped against the bright blue afternoon sky. Gorgeous.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/g0SxD5WKiW-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/g0SxD5WKiW-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/U-8CWCNJPW-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/U-8CWCNJPW-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Maps.me was in a good mood today, and picked a walking route to our guest room that passed through two parks. No major freeways for us! So we had a delightful walk to our room and for the first time, arrived feeling upbeat about our surroundings. (So far, our locations needed a day to grow on us.)</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fOYXgTx20q-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/fOYXgTx20q-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our guest room for the next three nights was in Manuela's house and it was a real treat. We had a huge, elaborately decorated room and a very large tiled bathroom with double sinks even. There were so many statuettes and icons around the room, so many armoires and dressers and side tables, so many tablecloths and doilies and other fabrics that we put our towel underneath our suitcases lest we get anything dirty. Perhaps the decor was better suited to an older couple, but we had a ton of space and Manuela was very nice. I think our Spanish was improving because our charades went more easily as we learned about all the keys and locks and how the doors work. We could even share pictures of the snowstorm back home and agreed things were better in Córdoba.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TZY-mLRZcI-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/TZY-mLRZcI-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our room was about 1km outside of the main tourist area and that's a very good thing. We kept discovering tiny fruit shops and cafes and gelaterias down side alleys that didn't even have signs out front. You couldn't tell they were there until you walked down the alley, so of course we walked down all the alleys and made sure we found them all. But wow was it tight. I measured our street, and wall to wall, including two 'sidewalks' and the road, was eleven feet wide. When a car came down the road we hugged the wall and hoped for the best.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PQPCgOzKNw-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/PQPCgOzKNw-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>When we felt claustrophobic, we'd walk two blocks to a small thoroughfare with wider sidewalks and more shops. This was our breakfast street every day. Friendly people, big glasses of orange juice, tiny glasses of strong coffee and tostadas. I discovered the local custom of spreading puréed tomatoes on my toast instead of jam and it was lovely.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Further down this street is the main square. Bars and restaurants ring the outside with City Hall in the middle. Then we turned the corner around City Hall and found Roman pillars! There were the remains of a Roman temple right beside City Hall! Amazing. While not as complete as the temple in Evora, it was still quite spectacular and a big surprise.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Most of the main square was blocked off for Easter processions, so we turned left and headed down to the Mesquita. It's a Mosque/Cathedral that is the centrepiece of tourism in Córdoba, but for now we just walked around it, through the winding alleys of the Jewish quarter and headed to the river.</p>\n<p>Córdoba is situated alongside the Guadalquivir River, which makes it a very strategic city, ever since Roman times. The Romans built a beautiful bridge across the river right near where the Mesquita now stands and as it was gorgeous evening, we strolled along the bridge for almost an hour, watching the ducks in the river, looking at the remains of windmills from Roman times, taking photos in the amazing evening light and watching the thousands of fellow tourists doing exactly the same thing. It was the start of Easter Break, so we saw our first busloads of high school and university students on a tour of Spain. It added to the overall energy level in the place, I guess.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rl_lY4PvC9-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/rl_lY4PvC9-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FfRCpaHv8u-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/FfRCpaHv8u-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tUXSa2YMxY-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/tUXSa2YMxY-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/O7RF-JT_Ql-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>While there is still city on the other side of the bridge, there isn't a whole bunch, so I could still see the rolling hills and green wheat fields in the distance, which warmed my heart.</p>\n<p>We continued our stroll along the river then headed back to our neighbourhood to find a place for supper. Just like in Granada, we stumbled across a crowd in front of one of the cathedrals, filling the whole plaza / intersection. Easter procession! So we hung out for a while, tried to chat with our neighbours, watched the children having fun and watched the police try to re-route traffic, including a massive tour bus that clearly made a wrong turn at some point. And then, just like Granada, the crowd dispersed before anything happened. Procession's suspended, someone said.

It was laundry day, so I googled the nearest laundromat and we headed away from downtown, 1km across the train tracks. It's another one of those big differences from Regina. At home, walking to a public laundromat, 1km across the tracks, is a scary bit of business. Sea Spray laundry at home isn't a lot of fun and certainly not a place I'd want to hang out. But boy were we ever surprised in Córdoba!</p>\n<p>First, we had to cross the tracks. But we couldn't find the tracks! Rather than the ugliness that splits downtown Regina and the Warehouse District, here they built a hill over the tracks, so the trains ran underground from the station to the outskirts of town. And on top of the hill, they built parks! And planted trees, and installed sculptures and fountains! It was gorgeous and something we totally need to do at home. I'm forwarding pictures to my city councillor and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t2q_8T2807-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/t2q_8T2807-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Promenade over the train tracks.

With automatic soap and softener dispensing so we didn't even need to buy soap. So we loaded up, set a timer on the phone and went for a walk around the neighbourhood. It was so pretty. Just your friendly neighbourhood shopping district, with butcher shops and fruit shops and fish shops and pharmacies and banks and anything else you'd need. Friends meeting on the corner to say hi. Children out for a walk with their grandparents. We wandered around with our mouths open, staring at how awesome it all was.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S0syv95a6G-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/S0syv95a6G-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2xc3HUzVFY-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2xc3HUzVFY-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our imagined need for private, detached houses with big yards at home means there just aren't enough people to support this level of commerce in a neighbourhood. At least that's what the real estate folks keep telling us. But these blocks of four story buildings with apartments and offices above stores on the ground floor sure look good to me. And everyone seemed happy enough. And Manuela's apartment is huge too. Massive even.

And there were purple hats too! This one actually happened and it was quite a bit of fun. The crowd was smaller than in Granada, but still big enough to make us find an alternate route to supper. We'd learn to call this a small crowd before the week was out. But as we drank wine and ate tapas, we watched the TV and got a hint of the fervour these processions cause all over Andalucia. The TV had pictures from Seville, Malaga, Cadiz, Huelva, Granada and Córdoba, showing crowds and processions getting underway all across the region.

First there was a Romman temple on the site. After the Romans retreated, the Visigoths built a Christian temple on the site. When the Moors conquered Spain, the site was split and Christians and Muslims worshiped side by side. Then in the 8th century, the Sultan in power bought the Christian half and built the largest Mosque in Western Europe on the site. Then, with the Christian re-conquest in the 13th century, a huge cathedral was built inside the Mosque. That is to say, the entire building is a cathedral, but the Christian bits have been added to the Muslim bits. So the whole structure looks rather odd. Muslim architecture but Christian icons, with a Gothic cathedral in the middle.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Fd9-V2RVTK-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/5AdT9Ggw7U-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IUx-m-lcKP-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/IUx-m-lcKP-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It's odd and overwhelmingly spectacular at the same time. We spent two hours looking up and taking pictures that in no way portray the grandeur of the place. Because it's an active Cathedral and not a museum, there's very little mention of the Muslim antecedents of the building. However there is a section at the back that has been left in it's original Moorish state. Plus there is a display of some remains of the Visigoth temple in one corner too. It's a shame, really, because there is so much layered history here that an interpretive pamphlet would really make the history come alive. There are private tour groups that do this; might be worth your while when you visit. Or read up ahead. Or just enjoy the majesty of the place.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ISaUz3R8KQ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>We were getting tapas'd out. The effort to interpreting Spanish menus and coming to decisions on what was or was not octopus was tiring us out. And that time I went to what I thought was a coffee shop on the plaza but learned they sold pails of snails really freaked me out. So for supper on our last night in Córdoba we decided in advance to head to the Jewish Quarter beside the Mesquita and find an Arabian place with couscous and chicken tajin. It was Wednesday night and we thought we'd be relatively safe from Easter procession crowds.

But our main street was packed; we could see Mary heading off down the road towards a church. There was no way that would work.</p>\n<p>So we took a left and tried to get ahead of the parade. If we could get ahead of the first purple hoods, it was polite to cross the road. So we leaped ahead of Mary's procession and got to the town square, but that was even more jammed. Jesus had already made it to the town square. So we went further left, parallel to the parade route, until we reached the river, then backtracked and got to the Jewish Quarter.</p>\n<p>We started looking for a restaurant with couscous and tajin (by that point I was actually craving couscous) but soon realized we were deep into the tourist zone. Too many English menus. Too many burgers. Too many cocktails. And the crowds kept growing and growing. Finally, after an hour of looking, we found a place with couscous on the menu and a table for two just inside the door. We ducked in and tried to ignore all the English being spoken around us.</p>\n<p>Soon we couldn't hear the English for all the drumming. Another procession was passing right beside the restaurant! Right by our table, in fact. I pushed outside and grabbed a few pictures between courses.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>For a &quot;TGI-Couscous&quot; this place wasn't too bad.

We headed to the river, away from our room, then walked along it until we were at least eight blocks past the Mesquita, the town square and even our little &quot;main street.&quot; Then north, then back and safely home.</p>\n<p>In all, we saw four different Mary floats and at least three Jesus floats, eight bands and five different colours of hoods. It was quite a night. But my favourite thing of all was the little kids collecting wax balls, drip by drip, from the candles carried by the hooded folk. And the hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, from the very young, to the very old, eating sunflower seeds along the parade route. And by morning, how it was all swept up so there was no way of knowing the processions even happened. But they did. And it was amazing.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>We left Seville with a touch of sadness, a feeling that will no doubt be a part of many departures on this trip. It was off to the bus station for a 3-4 hour trip east and south to Granada.</p>\n<p>Granada is one of the three jewels of Andalucia (the others being Seville and Cordoba) and is the most remote. Well, remote isn't really accurate, since Granada is a major city and tourist destination, but it is the last major destination still to be served by high speed trains. We passed the new track, still under construction, several times on the trip. But for now it was buses and that was fine with me.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The landscape along the trip was dramatic once again. Gone were the orange orchards of Portugal and western Spain. Now it was miles and miles of olive trees, stretching as far as we could see in all directions, through rolling hills and gently twisting roads. Every once in a while, we'd see an especially tall hill. In those cases, there was always a cluster of white walled houses up the side of the hill and a castle and walls on top. I scanned the distant hills for knights on horseback but could never pick them out.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>As we got closer to Granada we started to climb. Bare rocky outcrops thrust out of the ground. First a single mountain, then a group, and then we were fully in the mountains. Granada lies in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains and as we pulled into the city we could see snow covered peaks off in the distance. I learned that there's quite a nice ski resort off in those mountains, even though it was 15c in the city.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9lK1H0IRcv-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/9lK1H0IRcv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our room for the next three nights was the barest of the trip so far. It was basically a spare bedroom and access to the bathroom, in the house of Rafa and David, two young artists. They were very nice, the room was warm and the bed comfortable, and the location, right beside the main cathedral, was excellent. Even though we didn't really see them very much, we didn't feel comfortable hanging out in their house. So we were out on the street from morning till bedtime most days. When we came back to our room to dry off and warm up, we were often visited by their skinny black cat, who quite enjoyed my backpack for some reason. I have claw marks as a souvenir.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/a3MO7Gg1gm-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Granada is a very interesting city in that it was the last stronghold of Moorish (Muslim) rule in Spain. When the Christian crusaders invaded the Iberian peninsula around 1200AD, they came from the north and conquered cities like Seville and Córdoba, but took much longer to get south and east to Granada. In fact, it seems like there was acceptance of joint rule of the area for a time. When we were in Seville, I read of a palace in the centre of the city where the ruler hired artisans from all over Spain to work on the building, including Muslim artisans from Granada.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/npWbGaarWJ-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/npWbGaarWJ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Evidence of Muslim/Arabic culture is throughout the city but is especially strong in the Arabic quarter, a ghetto of narrow, hilly, twisting streets close to the main avenues. The area is full of tea rooms, hookah lounges and stores selling gorgeous glass lamps, leather goods and silver tea sets. We went to eat in this area twice during our stay, grateful for the delicious vegetable couscous and clay bowls with chicken tajin. But our big discovery was the array of delicious tea in these restaurants. Sweet, creamy concoctions with all kinds of spices. Our favourite was called 'sol y nieve', a strawberry and cinnamon tea with a mountain of whipped cream on top. It was an excellent after dinner selection that I fully intend to make at home somehow.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZdgEB7deyT-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ZdgEB7deyT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ij1kzK2jH4-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ij1kzK2jH4-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Leaving the Arabic quarter we strolled along the river, along cobblestone plazas full of restaurants and bars. Then we turned left and began to climb up a very steep hillside until we came to a lookout with great views of the city, the main cathedral (right by our room) and the fields and mountains beyond. And a spectacular view of the jewel of Granada, the Alhambra. This amazing palace, castle and garden sits high on the hill on the other side of the river, looming proudly over the city below. It was the last stronghold of Muslim rule in Europe and we were going to tour it tomorrow. But for now, we just looked across the valley and admired the grand structure.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_LntS8nbi0-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/_LntS8nbi0-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2gMLdeas6x-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2gMLdeas6x-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ojQoWVzEmR-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ojQoWVzEmR-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tlnVofP_f8-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/tlnVofP_f8-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>A communal oven!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Because the Alhambra is a major attraction, the authorities control how many people get in each day. They accept 6000 visitors per day and you can buy either a morning ticket or an afternoon ticket. And each ticket has a specific time where you can visit the Nazrid Palace, the high point of the trip. So on the bus ride into town, we bought 'morning' tickets for the next day, with a 1:30PM entry into the Nazrid Palace. We didn't know it at the time, but we were very lucky. All tickets for the entire weekend we were in Granada were sold out by the time we went to the tourist office to pick up our tickets, three hours after we booked them!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/iGPXUCP-DJ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>In the morning we grabbed an early breakfast and hiked up to the entrance of the Alhambra, trying to get a jump on the tour busses. It was a steep hike, but thanks to a tip from the lady at the ticket office yesterday, we did all our climbing at the start. We begin the tour at the Generalife Garden at the high point of the grounds, and strolled pretty much downhill from there. The massive formal garden was built as a place for the sultans to relax when life in the palace got too hectic. So long as we paced ourselves well between the Italian tour and the Japanese tour, we could get a sense of the tranquil nature of the place. I also got a thrill looking at the vegetable gardens that were neatly laid out on terraces below the formal garden. After days of orange-red or white soil, it was nice to see some deeper colour in the ground.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/a3aQyPbwZj-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/a3aQyPbwZj-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>From the gardens it was a nice stroll through a tiny village within the walls. There were some restaurants and souvenir shops but also a small shop where two men made very elegant and ornate boxes, platters, chess sets and backgammon boards. The were all intricately inlaid with different types of wood and then heavily lacquered. They were gorgeous and priced to reflect the hours of work that went into each piece.

When the Christians finally defeated the Moors in Granada, they took over the Alhambra complex and started converting it to a Christian palace. The first addition was a large cathedral in the middle of the site. Later it was followed by a massive palace, built for King Carlos V, in the middle of the main square. Our guidebook mentioned that the palace has divided opinion over the years. It's either an excellent example of 18th century architecture or an abomination in the middle of the Moorish aesthetic. Well, it doesn't look like anything else around it, that's for sure.</p>\n<p>There's a pattern evolving here that is interesting and a little sad. It's one of conquest and re-conquest all over this part of Europe, but is really apparent with structures like the Alhambra. Romans - Goths - Moors - Christians, and in the case of the Christian re-conquest, a need to rework the architecture to get rid of, or at least downplay, the Moorish influence. And then there's Napoleon. When the French invaded Spain they used the Alhambra as a barracks and nearly blew it up in the end.</p>\n<p>This comes up again and again in this region. When the Moors are conquered their architecture is changed, then Napoleon comes and nearly wrecks everything. Then, thankfully, someone recognizes the historical (and touristical) importance of these treasures and they are restored and a ticket office put in front. And I don't mind the ticket offices one bit because these are beautiful, beautiful places and deserve to be restored and celebrated.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9CPHADkUJ9-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/9CPHADkUJ9-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Getting back to the Alhambra, it was the American Washington Irving who is credited for opening people's eyes to the amazing Alhambra. He lived in Granada for a while after Napoleon left and the Alhambra was falling into disrepair. His writing about the place inspired the restoration work. Hopefully this writing inspires you to visit.</p>\n<p>The final tour before our time in the palace was the Alcazaba. This castle / walled area was the oldest part of the complex and afforded more incredible views of the city as well as the lookout we sat on last night.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>As we stood in line we met a foursome from Ontario who were travelling through Spain in the reverse order we were, but they were driving the whole way. I was amazed and a little dumbfounded, especially as they told me about taking wrong turns through the centre of Seville. Why anyone would choose to drive through these places when you could walk or take the transit is beyond me. They also told me they booked their tickets to Alhambra over a month ago, so I guess we were lucky to get ours the day before!</p>\n<p>And then it was our time to visit the Nazrid Palace. What a stunner. It was more elaborate and ornate than I imagined, but subdued too. When I think of a palace I think of precious metals or gems (I've not seen many palaces, but that's what I think!) but the Nazrid is amazing for different reasons. It's more about the artisans that built it. Every square inch of some walls are covered in ornate plaster carvings and Arabic script. Some ceilings have even more elaborate plaster domes, giving the impression of a starry night. Other halls had domed ceilings of stretched leather, which was then painted into elaborate patterns. The palace tour was an incredible climax to an already amazing tour of the grounds. It's well worth the trip to Granada to see.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/sf7J6ouKQM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/sf7J6ouKQM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lSbtNT09zJ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/lSbtNT09zJ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/T--4zIyUjC-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/T--4zIyUjC-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ZObWxMEYmr-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ZObWxMEYmr-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our last full day in Granada was Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week or Semana Santa in Spain. The entire week is a huge holiday in Spain, a combination of mourning and partying at the same time. The week starts off with a big procession, mourning the death of Jesus and Mary's sorrow. We had heard about these processions and were very excited to see one in person. Although, truth be told, it was a bit of a mystery as to where and when the procession would happen. Many of the central squares had been blocked off and large sets of bleachers installed, but as the day went on an we walked around the city, we never saw anyone sitting in the bleachers.</p>\n<p>Then at around 4pm, we saw more and more people heading off in the same direction, away from the bleachers, so we followed along. Soon we came to a different cathedral, with hundreds of people packed tight around the cathedral doors and sort of making a path down the block. I say 'sort of' because there's no such thing as an orderly line in Spain. But it seemed possible that we had made it to the procession route. Laughable attempts to communicate with the man standing next to me confirmed that the procession would start at the cathedral in about an hour. We had stumbled on front row seats!</p>\n<p>As we stood there, more and more people squeezed past us, even though I was sure there was no way more people could fit in this square. Our colourful Canadian outerwear must've screamed &quot;This Way Through&quot; because everyone seemed to pass beside or between us, even if we linked arms. A gaggle of teenage girls. Teenage boys with the most incredible Justin Beiber pompadours. Mothers with strollers. Old men with walkers. I'm not kidding.</p>\n<p>And then it started to rain. Out came 1000 umbrellas, or in our case, up went hoods. We would've stayed dry except that, without umbrellas, we were in the drip line of all our neighbours. Then slowly people started leaving. The procession was suspended, for how long nobody new, due to the rain.</p>\n<p>We were disappointed, but also wet and cold so we went back to our room to change clothes and warm up. We were just about to head out for supper when we heard drums and horns and followed the music to the main cathedral. There it was! The procession! We hurried over and found a place to stand behind a pair of strollers.</p>\n<p>Even though the procession is supposed to be for mourning, the entire event is quite the celebration. Everyone is dressed up, especially the little children. Vendors with carts selling drinks, candy, snacks (especially sunflower seeds - everyone was eating them, from the schoolchildren to young women to the elderly), balloons and toy drums lined each street. There was a huge amount of anticipation as we waited for the procession to pass.</p>\n<p>It really was quite a production. First, several dozen marchers disguised in robes and pointed hoods, carrying candles. Then a huge &quot;float&quot; of Jesus, carried by 20-25 young men, hidden underneath. The float was so heavy that every few minutes they'd have to set it down and have a rest, or trade with other men who followed the float.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bT1KPN3732-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/bT1KPN3732-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Can you see the people holding up the float, behind the screen?</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Behind the float were ladies of all ages in black mourning dresses and veils, followed by a marching band. Whenever the float was in the air, the band played. When the bearers rested, the drummers kept time. It was a very slow, solemn procession.</p>\n<p>The floats were so large that it was a real challenge to navigate through the narrow streets. Turning corners was especially dramatic. The bearers took two full minutes to slowly rock back, forth and forward to shimmy the huge float 90 degrees. When the job was complete, the crowd clapped and cheered in appreciation as the float headed off down the street.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a second procession came by. Hooded figures, then an even larger float of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by dozens of large candles. It was very dramatic in the twilight.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/XGnY_eXnwS-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/XGnY_eXnwS-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/t3OIMhUPQ--700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/t3OIMhUPQ--400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And as the Mary float made its way around the corner, we left the crowd and went in the opposite direction to find some supper.

I just want to sit down with some history books and really get the background on these places. But we keep moving on. Time to pop a few Gravol and head to the bus station...</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>We bid a fond farewell to Portugal in Tavira and climbed on the ALSA bus to Seville. There are no trains between Portugal and Spain this far south, so a four hour bus ride was required. But the ALSA buses are comfortable and they have electrical outlets between the seats so all was good.</p>\n<p>We've been getting pretty good at these 3-4 hour bus journeys by now. A perfect travel day starts with a 7:30AM alarm. Shower, pack and head off for a breakfast of coffee, orange juice and toast (tostas or toastadas.) If we like the pastelaria we are in, we'll buy a couple of sandwiches to eat on the bus. Otherwise, we'll stop somewhere else on the way back to our room.</p>\n<p>Once in our room, it's a quick bathroom break, then pick up our bags and head to the bus station. The perfect departure time is 12 noon, so we aren't rushed. Then we arrive at our destination by 3 or 4 pm, which is plenty of time to find our room, meet our host, and go for a first walk around town. Especially with Spanish time, this gives us a half day in our new town. Although our hosts think we're crazy to waken before 10AM for any reason.</p>\n<p>The bus ride into Spain was quite an adventure. We were stopped at the border for over 30 minutes. Inspectors came on board, looked at us sternly, then took the driver off for a while. No passports were checked, but when we stopped for a break in Huelva, a Norwegian passenger I was chatting with said the border inspectors were upset that there were not fasten seat belts signs on the back of every seat. Our bus only had them every six inches and on the window. So the driver was fined 300€ on the spot.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H1yKn0sIC6-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/H1yKn0sIC6-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>There isn't much of a change in landscape between the eastern Algarve and western Andalucia, but there is a change in agriculture. The orange orchards are replaced by mile after mile of plastic hoop houses. We were too far from the fields to make out what was growing under these greenhouses, but the plants looked happy. With the spacing of the plants my best guess is that they housed young orange trees.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>After the tranquility of the Algarve, entering Seville was a big culture shock. We exited the bus station on a massive eight lane road, completely jammed with cars, people packing the sidewalks and city busses buzzing by. And the maps.me app gave what seemed like crazy directions to our apartment. We left the busy boulevard soon enough, and seemed to be directed around in circles, twisting and turning through progressively narrower alley ways. At one point we even went through the inner courtyard of a row of buildings, or so it seemed (to be fair, there was a street sign on the wall leading into the courtyard.) But suddenly we popped out into a delightful little square ringed with food shops, walked down a busy street with sidewalks narrower than our suitcases, turned left and were at our apartment.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/z83PttjNkF-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/z83PttjNkF-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It was heaven. Pure heaven I tell you. Seville is the most amazing city, and if we hadn't agreed in advance to visit other places I would still be there. I don't think I could see it all in twenty years. Our flat was right near the Plaza Alfalfa (ah, memories of home) and if I never left the square I would still be happy. There were no less than three pastelarias on the square! I know! Plus three restaurants, a charcuterie place, a pharmacy and a playground in the middle. Then in the block between the square and our flat, there was a killer artisan bread bakery (also with coffee, orange juice and amazing pastries), two killer tapas bars (one so small and so constantly busy we never did get a table), a fruit market, a mini super market, and a florist. I'm not exaggerating even a little bit.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h3wuQTYPm2-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/h3wuQTYPm2-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>This fellow rides his motorbike to restaurants to sharpen the chef's knives.

We were continually getting lost, walking for an hour then popping up at Plaza Alfalfa again, or ending up at the Cathedral when we thought we were heading away from the Cathedral. But the great thing is that every single street, and I mean every, single, street is beautiful and interesting and packed with beautiful people. Sevillains (as we called them) are extremely fashion conscious and yet again we felt like frumpy foreigners around them. Had we wanted to, and had the 1000€ it required, we could've changed our look in an afternoon. The streets were lined with the most fashionable shops imaginable. Beautiful, colourful, stylish dresses and more suits, in more colours, than I have ever seen. There were many, many specialty clothing stores just for kids too - you can never start too young in Seville.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\"

Everything is just so bloody big, it's impossible to get things in the frame. Seville's Cathedral is the largest by volume in the world. It took over 100 years to build and let me tell you, it's a big 'un. It took forever to walk around, and would have even if the streets weren't clogged with tourists. Big, gothic and gaudy.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bkpqOwSAPw-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/bkpqOwSAPw-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Seville was the richest city in the world for a time, and it shows. When the Spanish colonized the Americas, Seville was awarded the contract to administer all the wealth coming from the New World. Ships laden with riches made their way up the Guadalquivir River to unload at Seville. So the city is full, and I mean full, of palaces, cathedrals and statues. The University of Seville is also right downtown and the main building is full of marble halls surrounding a massive courtyard.</p>\n<p>But for me, the most opulent structure in the city is the Plaza de España in Maria Luisa Park, and it's rather new. The park itself is huge and right downtown, full of statues and fountains and trees and formal pathways. But the Plaza is simply massive. Built in 1928, the plaza is a massive semi circle of connected buildings with a canal in the middle. Bridges connect the centre of the plaza and the outer ring, over the canal. Around the outer ring are a number of alcoves with scenes of Spanish provinces done in tile. We didn't know anything about the plaza before we stumbled on to it, and let me tell you it was quite a surprise.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/COF8qpCD51-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/COF8qpCD51-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/JCT59nNGIL-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/JCT59nNGIL-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/N4Ah9Kz3ah-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Most of our time in Seville was spent wandering the streets, looking in shop windows, eating picnic lunches in parks, eating tapas in the evening and generally getting lost. One afternoon we took a pedestrian bridge across the river to the suburb of Triana. At the base of the bridge on the Triana side was a wonderful indoor farmers market (perfect for picking up fruit, bread and Jamon Iberico for our picnic) and a park beside.

A massive roundabout at the base of another bridge forked into three wide avenues, one of which was pedestrian only. We walked for at least a mile from the roundabout to a fountain at the other end of the plaza, window shopping and finding the perfect gelato along the way. The street was full of happy people, most of which were locals enjoying the sunny afternoon.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wSZChztWcD-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/wSZChztWcD-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/geyateWmey-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/geyateWmey-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GAAWdysEB0-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/GAAWdysEB0-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Very cool bread delivery bike.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We did more window shopping in Triana than we planned, since it was now 3pm and we were fully into the afternoon siesta time. Most shops in Spain close in the afternoons. They'll be open from 10AM - 1:30 or 2pm, then close until 5pm or 5:30. Then they'll stay open till 8 or 9pm. So we gazed in the shop windows and thought of how much money we saved.</p>\n<p>But the plaza didn't empty. Oh, no. The stores closed but the bars were entering into their busiest time of the day. Along the plaza and the side streets were tiny bars full of people, standing shoulder to shoulder and spilling into the street. Businessmen, old ladies, moms with strollers, construction workers. Everyone. And they all had a glass of beer or wine in their hand and a small plate of tapas on the table. Sardines, olives, cheese, ham. Heavenly.</p>\n<p>We opted for a gelato stand and sat out on the street, watching the world go by. Then we made sure to get a little more to eat too; after two days in Seville we had learned that we wouldn't be eating supper any time soon. You see, the bars and cafes are for little bites only. For supper you need a restaurant. And restaurants don't even open until 8pm! The bar/restaurant combo places close from 6-8 too, so make sure you aren't hungry during the Canadian supper hour, or be sure to pack a snack.</p>\n<p>We were enjoying the local areas more than the tourist areas, so in our last day in Seville we headed in the opposite direction from our beloved Plaza Alfalfa toward the Alemeda de Hercules. Legend has it Seville was founded by Hercules and this long, wide Avenue celebrates the legend. It took us a while to find it, but the avenue was worth the hunt. Two tall pillars stand at either end of this long pedestrian walkway, with people walking down the middle, cars along the outside, and shops and cafes the whole way along it. It was a smaller version of the Avenue de Liberdores in Lisbon, and not as chic, but we loved it.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Then we walked back down toward the river, around the bull ring and back toward the Cathedral for the evening. Our waiter at breakfast had recommended some places to eat and hear flamenco. We had a long night ahead.</p>\n<p>Our first stop was a restaurant near the Cathedral that offered a private flamenco concert in the back. A drink, tapas and front row seats. This was a professional quartet; a man playing guitar, a young woman and young man who danced, and a matron (who was in reality quite young) who sang. It was an amazing show. Lively, exciting, colourful and full of passion. We were blown away. It was a wonderful show in an intimate venue, but it was quite polished compared to what we saw next.</p>\n<p>Our second stop was a small bar closer to our apartment. We nearly missed it. There was a tiny sign over the door that was difficult to notice, but the fact that people kept going in two by two was a hint that something was happening. But inside was empty. Just a grizzled old man in a heavy wool sweater, tending an ancient fireplace just inside the door.</p>\n<p>We walked past the man and turned down the hallway, following the faint sound of guitar. Then we came into a large, low room, more like a garage out back, with long benches filled with people and a bar off to the side. Flamenco music and male singing was coming from somewhere in this mess but I couldn't see where it came from.</p>\n<p>Then we found it. Over in the corner, where only a few people could really see, were three men. They were all seated. The oldest man was about 60 and he played guitar. The man in the middle was younger, say 40 years old and sang. And the man on the left, small, clad all in black, with a pony tail and beard like in a tequila ad, clapped, chanted, then got up and danced.</p>\n<p>They played and danced for 20 minutes or more, while people jockeyed around them for a better view or jockeyed to the bar for another drink. Where the first show was polished and electric, this performance was dark and smoky and passionate. We were swept away by the romance of the whole thing. I should be back there still, sweeping floors, washing glasses and listening to that haunting music.</p>\n<p>But I'm a family guy at heart so after the performance we left that bar, arm in arm, and just wandered the streets of Seville one last time. It was getting on to midnight now and we started thinking about finding our way home. But then we'd see some people on the corner and would wander by to check out that bar. Or we'd hear music and head down to the next corner. Finally we heard more guitars and more singing, and walked down one more block to a square with three restaurants beside each other. In front of the middle restaurant was a long table with a dozen or more men, all with guitars or mandolins. It looked like a meeting of a local guitar club and they had decided it was time to play.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I don't know how long they had been playing before we got there, but they played for an hour longer at least. One man would sing. One would play a solo. Everyone sang the chorus, with gusto. A few men would come out into the gathered crowd and ask women to dance. Another passed the hat and bought beer for the players wth the proceeds.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And it seemed like it wouldn't end. One or two men would pack up, then 10 would perform a song. The lead singer would come back out from the bar for one more song. Then there were 8 players, then 6, then 4.</p>\n<p>Slowly, oh so slowly, the mini-concert ended and we wandered back to Plaza Alfalfa, wishing we could stay in Seville forever. Get cleaned up, buy some fashionable clothes, get jobs in a pastelaria and spend our nights singing and dancing and holding hands in a plaza we never knew existed before and may never find again.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>We're fine. But I'm a little spooked.</p>\n<p>We were sitting in a cafe in Córdoba, Spain, having a late lunch, when the TV cut to the bombings in Brussels. As you no doubt know, two bombs went off in Brussels and if I can read Spanish properly, the authorities found a third that failed to go off. Many people dead. In southern Spain, according to the news at least, people are worried.</p>\n<p>It's the height of their Easter festival here and I would assume it's prime time for something nasty to happen. Although, personally, I'll be more worried when we head north in May.</p>\n<p>It's 'the day after' as I write this and things seem normal here, although there are a lot more police patrolling the cathedrals and main tourist areas this morning. We toured the Mosque/Cathedral this they checked our bags before we went in. There were three Muslim fellows in front of us in line and I'm sad to tell you that they made me a little nervous. But I guess that's what happens when anyone could have a bomb strapped to them.</p>\n<p>The men made some other tourists nervous too, mainly with the pictures they were taking. Two tourists talked to security, who then spoke to two police officers (who were walking around with their shotguns out) who then spoke to the Muslim men. We watched for a while as they police gave their papers a very good look. One of the Muslim fellows spoke good Spanish (thank goodness) and had a long, calm conversation with the police officers. We left before it ended but it appeared that everything was going to be OK.</p>\n<p>So it's not a good time to be Muslim and walking around in Europe. Or from what I've read, the USA either. I don't know about Canada, but I assume it's not much fun at home too. And I get it, I guess. But there's something that's sticking in me, especially because all this is happening when we're in Córdoba, where the main attraction is the Mosque/Cathedral. After the Roman's left, this piece of land was a Cathedral in the time of the Visigoths, then a shared Muslim/Christian space, then the largest Mosque in Western Europe, then a Cathedral only. All with a span of 1300 years. Recently, Muslims have been trying to get access to the space to pray again and the Christians aren't going to let that happen any time soon.</p>\n<p>My point being that all sorts of people have lived in this land for many, many hundreds of years. Some times one group is in power and the other are suppressed. Then things change and another group is in power. But always someone in power, someone gets the short end. Roman, Visigoth, Muslim, Christian, Monarchist, Republican, Fascist, Republican. It doesn't matter. Somebody wants to get rich and can justify taking things. Then we justify keeping things, and fearing 'the others' until someone comes and takes it from us. It's true in Spain and it's true in Saskatchewan. And it makes me sad.</p>\n<p>We've been walking around a very beautiful city this morning; beautiful specifically because of the mix of cultures who have built this place. And all I can think about is fear and hate.</p>\n<p>All I can think about is whether humans are doomed to always fear or hate 'the others.' And whether we are doomed to be ruled by someone, be it a warlord, King, President, MP, MLA or CEO who gains and keep power by playing on those fears. And what would it take for us all to really, truly, live and let live.</p>\n<p>I don't know. We'll keep on travelling, with our eyes open, and with our hearts open too. And I'll try really hard not to get nervous just because the guy beside me looks different than I do.</p>\n<p><em>PS. More light hearted travel fare tomorrow.</em></p>\n",

Instead, the coast is all marshland and salt flats. They do a nice trade in sea salt in Tavira and area. But they do have beaches, you just need to take a boat to the far side of the lagoon. In the high season there's a ferry right from the town square, but since this was winter and only a sunny 20c, we walked 2km to the outer ferry station to catch the hourly ferry to Ilha de Tavira. We had plenty of time to make the 11 o'clock ferry, but we decided to check out the market on the way and cut it a little close. We had to cover the last 1100 metres in exactly 11 minutes or wait an hour for the next ferry. We just made it, we walked on just as the pilot cast off from the dock. All it took was, as Cindy calls it, walking with purpose. I tied my loose shoelace on the other side.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2q8cS5nxpz-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2q8cS5nxpz-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>The market that almost lost us our ferry ride.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The beach at Tavira was excellent, but completely different than the high cliffs and heavy surf of the west coast.

We got caught up in the first Easter procession of the season in Tavira - bands, town officials, church groups, Boy and Girl Scouts and two large floats went throughout the town, stopping at several stations along the way to the Cathedral. The stations were really interesting because they were permanently set up. The doors were opened just for the procession, but they are there on the street the rest of the year. But if you weren't from the town, you'd have no idea what was behind the wooden doors.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lam5eytvsE-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/lam5eytvsE-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DA5M6aRsX1-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/DA5M6aRsX1-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cI8qgAAtLj-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/cI8qgAAtLj-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LdBegdylR4-400.avif 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LdBegdylR4-400.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/LdBegdylR4-400.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/LdBegdylR4-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>One of the stations throughout the town.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tavira is a wonderful little town and I highly recommend visiting, especially if you want to relax for a few days.

But we really, really loved Portugal. Great sites, great food and wonderful, friendly people, from the hustle and bustle of Lisbon to the tiniest villages of Monchique and Odeceixe. We loved every minute in this beautiful country and can't wait to visit again. There's so much more to see. We could've stayed longer in Lisbon. We never made it to Sintra, or even Setubol and Troia. Not to mention the northern cities of Porto and Coimbra, or the ruins at Conimbriga, or the Duoro valley. There's another long trip in there, for sure.</p>\n",

It was Saturday morning, so we figured there must be some pastelarias open even in a village as tiny as this. I was very pleasantly surprised to see a Paderia (bread bakery) sign on a side street, however.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Bread bakery down a narrow side street\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>You need to check every side street. Magic awaits!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The inside of the bakery was very small but the shelves were full of bread, buns and croissants. I had my morning coffee and pastry and tried, in my best Portuguese, to explain that I was a baker and their bread looked very good. I made some sense, because the clerk called over the owner (who spoke very good english) and she invited us next door to the bakery.</p>\n<p>The owner's mother, a delightful elderly lady who only spoke Portuguese gave us a tour of the shop. Two huge mixers, a big work bench, and a massive deck oven. The bakery was spotless; the bakers came in at 8pm Friday night to do the baking so by 10am Saturday, all the work was done.</p>\n<p>Then she surprised the heck out of me. She took us around the side of the oven and showed me a room with wood stacked floor to ceiling. The deck oven was wood fired! There was a small firebox beside the deck oven which held the fire. I don't really know how she regulated the heat, but I think the fire heats a boiler and the oven is heated by circulating hot water (you can buy gas fired 'steam tube' ovens in North America.) Still, I don't know how they could adjust things in a wood fired oven that large.</p>\n<p>And then we were back on the road, heading south along the coast to Arrifana. It's an area that came highly recommended by the lady at the Faro tourist office and it did not disappoint in any way. We parked high up on the top of a cliff, far too scared to drive down to the beach, then walked along the top, through a small village, to a point overlooking the Atlantic. Sheer cliffs and broken rocks were all around us, with the surf pounding the rocks below.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e1WIKg5oii-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/e1WIKg5oii-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Bw_lCh1i5O-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It looked dangerous and it was. We saw a steady stream of locals walking and driving north to the edge of the cliff. When we looked out past them, we saw a rescue helicopter and two boats alongside some particularly nasty looking rocks. We couldn't make out their objective, but the helicopter flew so low, and hovered for so long, that I'm certain they were performing a rescue. After 20 minutes or so the helicopter left and the locals went home. I hope whoever they were helping are alright today.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6LHJWmJFWn-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/6LHJWmJFWn-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/aGR4TI4bP9-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/aGR4TI4bP9-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Then we went down to the beach, along a narrow, twisting road with three switchbacks and a steady line of camper vans and surfer dudes.

But we scrambled over the rocks as close to the edge as we dared (we were still very high up above the water) watched the fishermen bobbing violently in their boats near the cliff walls, had a nice conversation with two travellers from Minnesota, then headed east, back into Portugal, to another beach we had passed on the drive to the tip.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/N9xz-G0o6m-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/N9xz-G0o6m-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6oAUj6fDTY-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/6oAUj6fDTY-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/bdikCbe275-700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/bdikCbe275-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>I'm not exactly sure of the name of our final beach of the day, but it was just east of Cabo St. Vincente. It didn't seem possible, but the water was clearer, the surf was livlier, and the cliffs more spectacular than any of the beaches we had been to so far. Perhaps it was because the hike down was steeper and more treacherous than any other; no cobblestones here, just irregular steps with many of the rocks broken away. Or maybe it was because there were no more than a dozen people on the entire beach. But it was thrilling, and we dawdled along for over an hour here.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/i4oo-kI8Gv-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--700.avif 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--700.webp 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mvKUdXBL6--700.jpeg 700w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/mvKUdXBL6--400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>At the very end of the beach, were the sand, surf and rocks met, there was a little cave that we could just get to without swimming.

Through Sagres, Lagos and Portimao, stopping beside the highway for another bag of oranges. East past Faro and Olhao, and on to our final stop in Portugal, Tavira. Here the guidebooks, Cindy's research and the Faro tourist office lady all agreed - Tavira is a delightful place to finish a tour of the Algarve. But that's for another post.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><em>Embedding photos is still a bear with my iPad.  But if you want to follow along, <a href=\"http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Algarve-post-1\">here's a photo gallery covering the areas we went to in this post.</a></em></p>\n<p>After our tour of dolmans and megaliths was over, Libanio dropped us off near our apartment. We ran upstairs, grabbed our bags and walked (&quot;with purpose&quot; as Cindy says) down the alley,through the city gate, down the road to the bus depot and straight on the bus to Faro. Five minutes early, I might add!</p>\n<p>Faro is the capital of the Algarve region of Portugal. It's the most southern strip of the country, bordering Alentejo on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, Spain on the east and the Mediterranean Sea on the south. You might say it's the Tourist Area - pretty much all my Canadian friends who tell me of their winter escapes to Portugal go to the Algarve for the beaches, golf and food.</p>\n<p>But before we could see the beach, we had to go through the mountains on the northern border of the Algarve. While not tall be Rocky Mountain standards, they were a big change from the rolling hills of Alentejo. While we travelled on the main north/south highway, we traveled straight through, but as we exited for the various bus stops on the way the roads twisted and turned quite a bit.</p>\n<p>I will admit, our first impression of Faro was poor. But we were on the bus, travelling too fast past hotels, shopping malls and outlet stores. And of course the bus depot was in a seedier area of town. But as we walked to our guest room for the next two nights, the streets opened up and it was really quite nice.</p>\n<p>We were staying in the &quot;old city&quot; which dates back to the 13th century and was full of our favourite narrow cobblestone streets. And just outside the city walls were 6-8 twisty blocks of pedestrian only streets full of shops, pastelarias, gelaterias and restaurants. Plus, being on the Mediterranian coast, Faro had a harbour, with a long promenade that we walked at least six times, to and from our room.</p>\n<p>While the weather was sunny and mild for us, around 18C, you could tell it gets hot in the summer, since all the streets had white sailcloth stretched between the buildings, providing shade for the shoppers. So we walked around the shopping district, then over to the public garden (with more of my coffee kiosks!) and to the local library. We spent an hour browsing the stacks, looking for books we recognized, even if we couldn't read them since they were all in Portuguese. Although I did browse through an interesting history of Portuguese postage stamps and learned stamps were called &quot;selo&quot;, which really would've helped at the post office in Evora.</p>\n<p>Now we were at a crossroads. Before we left home, we planned on traveling to the Atlantic side of the Algarve, but the bus schedules were against us. Many of the areas we wanted to visit are hard to get to in the height of summer, and are pretty much impossible to reach in low season. One bus in at 9AM, one out at 9PM, etc. We'd be spending all our time and money on bus rides and not see anything. So we decided to break our pre-trip promise and rent a car. We found a place near the airport which rented cars with automatic transmissions (they had exactly one in stock) and after promising with our lives that we wouldn't damage it further (it was already missing one light and had dents in all four corners and all four sides) we were on the highway to Monchique.</p>\n<p>A brief word about European cars. I love them. We were driving a Citroen, and though I really wanted a tiny Fiat, or a jazzy Renault even, the Citroen was fine. But their automatic transmissions are really strange. I think they just took a manual and slapped a robot shifter on it. There's no &quot;Park&quot; so the car will still roll on you and shifting through the first three gears was as rough as if I were shifting myself. Plus there's 'eco' mode, where the engine shuts off at stops and restarts when you release the brake. I thought it was stalling for the longest time. I will learn to drive a manual next trip, I promise.</p>\n<p>With all the taxis to the airport, rental contract stress and 'Eco' mode, I was getting rather agitated. Hungry too, because we did all this before breakfast. So we decided to stop in the town of Sao Bras de Alportel for a bite. One wrong turn had me trying to park on the narrowest street in town but we survived and were fed. From this point we parked at the first blue &quot;P&quot; sign on the outskirts of each town in which we stopped!</p>\n<p>Tummies full, we headed west toward Silves.  This off the beaten track town is renowned for its castle which was built, modified and rebuilt by both the Moors and Christians.  While the exterior of the castle is intact and old, the &quot;rooftop&quot; interior has been added to recently, with a rather smart walking path, garden and restaurant.  Plus, there's a nice exhibit on the plight of the Iberian Lynx in a massive indoor chamber, which was originally a water cistern in Moorish times.  Boy, even the water cisterns are amazing to behold!  We spent an hour or so roaming around the castle, ate lunch on a bench admiring the castle walls and palm trees, then hiked back to the car.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/r4kCHIn9Sh-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/GEP-oP3vGZ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Our final destination the first day was Monchique, a tiny village deep in the Algarve hills. The drive to Monchique was superb. Clean, smooth pavement, no traffic at all, my lovely navigator beside me helping negotiate roundabouts and all around us, blue skies, high hills, deep valleys and tiny villages with their white houses and red roofs clustered in pockets on the hillside.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\" \" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>A kind grandma selling her oranges beside the highway</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We wound are way through the central Algarve for over an hour until we got to Monchique, hastily parked the car and found a room for the night. We stayed in a nice room at a B&amp;B right beside the tourist office, staffed by a tiny old lady who was so small she couldn't reach the board on the wall to get our room key. All she wanted was 40 euros cash and assurance that we'd leave the keys at the desk. Oh, and we needed to understand there would be no breakfast tomorrow. I think we were the only guests that night and it was too much bother to make breakfast for one. That was no problem, because Monchique has a lovely square at the very bottom of the hill town which just begged to be occupied in the early morning sunshine.</p>\n<p>The next morning we were up early, checked out and put our bags in the car. But then we left the village on foot; we had a mountain to climb. Monchique is near the Foia, the highest point of land in Portugal. At 902 metres, it isn't anywhere near the tallest mountain in Europe, but it was the tallest here and within our grasp. So we wound our way through the village, past the convent and started on the trail.</p>\n<p>The 4km walk was tougher than I expected. I guess my climbing legs didn't stick with me once we left Lisbon, plus the trail was very rough. Lots of loose rocks and quite large rocks at that. It also didn't help that there weren't many trees after the first kilometre or so. We had great views of the surrounding hills and saw that there weren't many trees there either. The entire surrounding hillside had been clear cut, including a large section of the trail. We walked through churned up land, logs and stumps. Where new trees had been planted, and only a very small area had been replanted, the native trees were replaced with tall, straight and foreign Eucalyptus trees.</p>\n<p>Back in Evora, Libanio told us many landowners are growing Eucalypts for pulp and paper production, since they grow so fast. But they need a lot of water and don't add to the undergrowth in the forest. So what you get is trees growing on what looks like rough gravel, with no foliage underneath. And where there were no Eucalypts, entire hillsides were bare or covered with a tight, dense, green blanket of waist high thorn bushes. It was a much different walk in the woods than we were used to at home.</p>\n<p>But we kept walking and gingerly picked our way up the trail, and it wasn't too long before we reached a paved road up to the summit. The road was paved because the summit of Foia is used for cell towers. There's a little village of maintenance huts and towers at the very top. But the views all around the summit were amazing. Hills and valleys and villages and fields surrounded and on a clear blue morning we could see for miles. We had bagged our first peak. We'll be sure to do this again in the Netherlands. :)</p>\n<p>Once we got back to the car, we took off north and west, along twistier roads than the day before, over and out of the Algarve hills and out to the Atlantic coast. The roads were amazing. So twisty that I could only drive 50-60 km/h but I was the only car on the road. So we took it easy and cruised to the west coast. Before long we left the hills and got back to straighter roads and farmland. Then, cliffs.</p>\n<p>The southwest coast of Portugal is known for its high cliff sides and crashing surf, dotted with gorgeous sandy beaches. There were dozens of beaches along the coast, too many to see them all, but we went to three on the west side - Zambujero do Mar, Odeceixe and Arrifana. Zambujero do Mar was the furthest north, so we drove there first. It was stunning. A tiny resort village with buildings right up to the edge of the cliff, then, far below, a U shaped beach of smooth brown sand and amazing blue water. There were two or three tiny cafes at the edge of the cliff with incredible views so, of course, we picked the prettiest one for lunch!</p>\n<p>After an amazing lunch, we were sad to learn that access to the beach was blocked. Construction crews were rebuilding the cobblestone road and sidewalk leading down to the beach, so the beach was closed. It was so frustrating to see all that beauty and not be able to get a closer view. But we were very close to our goal for the day, so we got back to the car and drove down the coast to Odeceixe.</p>\n<p>Odeceixe (pronounced O-da-saysh) was the real reason we rented the car. Long before we left home, Cindy read about this tiny village on the west coast border between Alentejo and the Algarve and wanted to go. She asked everyone we met about Odeceixe and they all agreed it was beautiful. So how could we miss it?</p>\n<p>The village is 3km from the coast, along a river that flows out to the ocean. We stopped in the village, found a room for the night (I think it was the first time the room was used this year) then drove down to the beach.</p>\n<p>Although our guidebooks talked about walking along the river to the beach (the hike was what caught Cindy's imagination) we drove rather than walked because, well, we'd already climbed a mountain in the morning. It was a good call, because there wasn't really a trail along the river anyway. We would've just been walking on the roadside and it required a lot of climbing.</p>\n<p>The beach at Odeceixe was splendid in every way. Restaurants, cafes and beach houses at the top of the cliff, a glorious clean, pristine beach down below, crashing surf and great light since it was almost sunset. This beach had the added bonus of a second freshwater beach where the river emptied into the ocean. We walked all over the ocean side, then followed the river upstream for a bit, waved hello to the fishermen on the opposite river bank and generally smiled a lot. It was a beautiful sunset in a gorgeous setting. We drove back to the village, ate a pizza and drank too much wine at a cafe in the village square, I sampled some of the local hooch (a liquor I can't pronounce mixed with honey - delicious) and we staggered back to our room and fell asleep instantly. What a full day.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><em>Hi.  I've been having a terrible time this week getting photos up to the website.  First Cindy had a problem with her camera (fixed) then I can't seem to get strong enough WIFI for the pictures to upload.</em></p>\n<p><em>Rather than wait, and forget where I was or what I was doing, I'm going to post some updates picture free.  Then when I get pictures loaded, I'll post a photo gallery or something.  Sorry about that!  Mark.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update: let's try this.  <a href=\"http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Evora-Post\">Here's a link to a photo gallery of our Evora pictures.</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Now, here's what happened in Evora...</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the skies cleared from the afternoon rain shower, we left Estremoz and headed back to Evora. Evora is the capital of the Alentejo region and is a sight to behold when you come in the late afternoon, from the northeast, and gaze upon the hill and the cluster of white walled houses gleaming in the sun. Then you pass under a massive aqueduct that trails off into the countryside, ride alongside the tall city walls and finally pass through the walls, on foot, to your flat in the inner city. It's romantic as all get out. Cindy and I bounced along the Main Street into the city, then through a maze of progressively narrower alleyways until we met Maria, our Airbnb host, and got the keys to our apartment.</p>\n<p>Compared to our cramped top floor flat in Lisbon, Maria's apartment was massive. We entered into a large living/dining room with our bedroom off the side. To our right was a massive kitchen with stone floors and an ancient chimney over the stove, a large marble sink and a 10 foot ceiling. Maria works in a restaurant and clearly loves food because the kitchen was laid out for serious cooking. The bathroom was through the kitchen at the back of the building.</p>\n<p>The only challenge with Maria's apartment was that, like Evora outside, and Alentejo in general, it was COLD! The region is designed for the long, hot, dry summers and the buildings are designed to stay cool. Portuguese people just bundle up and get through winter, I guess. So there's no central heating and no way to really get the house warm. So we wore our outdoor clothes inside again and dreamed of buying sweaters and slippers once the shops opened.</p>\n<p>There was no way Maria's tiny portable heater was going to subdue her large apartment, so we closed the door to the kitchen, sacrificing it and the bathroom to the cold. We propped the heater between the living room and bedroom and let 'er rip. With the help of a few blanket/shawls we were fine. So long as we remembered to put on shoes when heading to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Evora is very old. That is to say, there's been a city on this hill for a very long time. It was a major centre in Roman times. There are ruins of a temple at one of the high points of the city, and the remains of a Roman bath under City Hall. But the current city was built on top of the Roman plan in the 1500s AD. That's right, what we're looking at and walking around is 'only' 500 years old.</p>\n<p>Evora has an intact set of city walls, so the population of 40,000 either lives &quot;inside the walls&quot; or &quot;outside the walls.&quot; Although with everyone living on compact streets and in tiny apartments, I suspect a great majority of people still live inside the walls.</p>\n<p>Because Evora is built on a hill, with all roads leading to the central square, it helps to imagine the city like a clock. The square is in the centre of the dial, but stretches across the face towards 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock. The Roman era Temple of Diana is still in the middle, but towards 9 o'clock. The Cathedral is just to the left of centre, and the wide &quot;central&quot; square is more to the right, toward 3 o'clock. With me? Then let's take a tour.</p>\n<p>We came into Evora from the bus depot, outside the city walls, right at the bottom (6 o'clock.) Our apartment was right near the entry to the walled city, but let's say at 7 o'clock. But our first adventure was a further away, right at 9 o'clock beside the temple of Diana. That's where we found the aqueduct.</p>\n<p>Growing cities need lots of clean, drinkable water to feed its population. And in hot, dry Alentejo, the lack of drinking water was really holding Evora back. So the Romans built an aqueduct to carry water from the river in the hills 15km outside town. That is to say, they built a 15km long gravity fed stone water trough that steadily and consistently flows down from springs in the distant hills to the end point high up in the hill city of Evora.</p>\n<p>After the fall of Rome, the aqueduct fell into disrepair, but was rebuilt in the 1500's and again in the 1800's. It still looks ancient and amazing.</p>\n<p>We found the endpoint of the aqueduct near the ruins of the Temple of Diana. Even though at some points the structure towers 30 feet overhead, the endpoint is a small building no more than 6 feet above ground. But from there the structure extends along the street, outside town, then turns left and runs past a convent and into the hills.</p>\n<p>While the land rises and falls, the aqueduct must maintain a steady slope, dropping at most 10m every kilometre. So at times, the structure is quite low to the ground, or even goes underground in places. But when the land falls away, the aqueduct is the largest thing in the landscape.</p>\n<p>We followed its path along the road, around the convent, and through farmer's fields for 4 kilometres until we'd had enough. The sun was setting soon and we were a good distance out of town, so we found a road that would loop back to the 6 o'clock gate into the walled city and followed it home. We climbed quite a bit into the hills while following the aqueduct, so the downhill stroll home was a nice treat. It was an idyllic evening, cool and clear. We even had to stop for a herd of cows to cross the road to get back to the barn. 60 cows and calves with a single farmer following behind and calling instructions to the herd. How lovely!</p>\n<p>The next day, we spent a lot of time walking and exploring the side streets off the main square. We saw the temple of Diana and walked up to the massive Cathedral, then down to the University of Evora (2 o'clock), which dates to the 1700's and is right at the edge of the city walls. We found a very cute pastelaria near the University that was so good we tried to go again the next day, and got wonderfully lost before giving up. Then we turned the corner and there is was. Many of the pastry shops get all their products from the same bakeries, but our favourite was different. The lady behind the counter was the same lady who did all the baking and was in the dozens of pictures on the wall, each time posing with a local celebrity.</p>\n<p>Around from the University toward the southeast corner of the city (4 o'clock) is a wonderful, large public garden. When the cities are full of buildings and cobblestones and cathedrals and ruins, it's nice to have a green space. In the afternoons especially, the park was full of kids playing and people just hanging out at one of the several bar kiosks throughout the park.</p>\n<p>A word now for these amazing green beacons of joy. Throughout Portugal, in parks, plazas and public squares, you will find a tiny green kiosk with small tables and red chairs in front. These tiny oases are fully stocked - ice cream, candy, water, espresso, wine, beer and a fully stocked bar. Some even have newspapers and magazines and lotto tickets. Often they even have a TV on in the corner showing a soccer game. What an immensely civilized structure! I have yet to pass one without smiling and I can't pass three without stopping for an espresso. Why are there not 7 of these spaced around Wascana Lake?!?!</p>\n<p>On our final morning in Evora, Cindy arranged a special treat. She contacted a retired University professor named Libanio Merteira Reis to take us on a tour of some sites around Evora that were very old indeed. Much, much older than the Romans. Before the dawn of recorded history, even.</p>\n<p>Archeologists have found evidence of settlements on the Iberian Peninsula from the Neolithic age. That is, from the time of the very first humans, over 30,000 years ago. And the area around Evora contains some of the best discoveries on the peninsula.</p>\n<p>After some context setting at a local museum, we took off into the country in Libanio's Volvo. Our first stop was a cave near Escaurol. In 1963, some quarrymen blasted a hillside to loosen it up a little and found a cave entrance. Inside the entrance were human bones. Archeologists took a look at the remains and the cave beyond and realized that the bones were, in the whole scheme of things, rather recent additions.</p>\n<p>What the miners had really created was a new 'back door' into a sanctuary where it is believed that early humans have gathered for tens of thousands of years. But they would have entered through a long, narrow tunnel that opened up into this larger sanctuary.</p>\n<p>Tours to the Escaurol caves are tightly controlled. Only around 1000 people are allowed in each year, so we felt very fortunate to be allowed inside. In the sanctuary are faint paintings and etchings in the rock wall. Horses heads, pregnant cattle and other symbols. They are very tough to see and many are covered over in places due to calcification on the cave wall. But still, we're talking the very, very beginning of human civilization. These markings are from a time when humans first started to settle in one place; to move from being hunter-gathers to forming communities.</p>\n<p>After we left the cave and continued our drive through the beautiful Alentejo countryside, Libanio told us that these caves were used as burial chambers for the mightiest members of the group. And when a cave wasn't available, the community would build a structure called a 'dolman' to replicate a cave. We were off to see a very large dolman now.</p>\n<p>So I'm sure you know about the pyramids in Egypt, right? Massive burial chambers, really. So now imagine a very similar things being built, several thousand years earlier, in what is now Spain and Portugal. Huge stone slabs cut from local hills, hauled and stacked to form a round structure with an opening facing the sunrise. A hallway extending the opening, built of smaller stones. Then cap stones over the whole thing. And then, the entire structure being buried to create an artificial hill, with an artificial cave inside. That's a dolman.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, the soil around the dolman eroded, exposing the stones. We were able to climb up the back side and see inside (the cap stone was dragged off and broken by an early archeologist many years ago.) Each of the side stones was truly huge - at least 12-15 feet above ground. Now, 10,000 years later, it looks like a pile or rocks, until you realize that people had to cut them with only Copper Age tools and haul them without the invention of a wheel. Remarkable.</p>\n<p>Our final destination on the tour was a Really Big Deal. The Megaliths - a group of 90 standing stones set in an oval pattern to denote the changing of the seasons. Similar in purpose to the other standing stone sites like Stonehenge, but 3,000 years older than their more famous English cousin. And with several of the stones having engravings and symbols on them that are still visible if the light is right.</p>\n<p>And here's the thing. You can walk right up to them. Walk around them. Contemplate them. Think of what they mean and how the site was used. I hear there's a big rope around Stonehenge so you can't get close, but we could take a rubbing on the stones if we wanted to (we didn't!). With the exception of the Escaurol caves, all these sites were free, open and fully accessible. Fun and scary at the same time.</p>\n<p>The private tour with Libanio was our first 'big ticket' item of our trip but it was oh so worth it. Libanio helped us put our visit to Evora into real context. Yes, we were tracing the steps of the Romans and the Renaissance Portuguese, but in Evora we were also retracing the steps of some of the very earliest human settlements.</p>\n<p>It really got me thinking about my life in Regina. I mean, we tell people that Regina is just over 100 years old. And yes, there were the First Nations people before that. But I remember a visit I took to the petroglyphs near Willow Bunch when I was a kid. I need to get back there soon and reconnect to the first peoples of North America too.</p>\n<p>That's what I was thinking after Libanio dropped us off in Evora mere minutes before our bus out of town. We were leaving Alentejo and heading south, into the Algarve. But that's for another post.</p>\n",

This booth had a line all day long.  We waited 10 minutes and we were lucky.  The other stand was run by a young man and I never saw a single person go to that stand.  There's an interesting story there but my Portuguese isn't strong enough to get the scoop.</p>\n<p>The unique trick to Fartura is the batter is squeezed out in a continuous, circular spiral, flipped as a single unit, then cut (by madam) into long sticks and then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Two sticks made up one portion and most people bought two or three portions to take home. We tucked into ours before we had even left the line. Delicious!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/PZW3Tjs0Il-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"the Fartura vendor removing a large coil of deep fried dough from the oil, using a long metal rod.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>There was so much more to the market.  One seller specialized in pet birds, from tiny chickadees to peacocks.  There were many plant growers selling bedding plants (they'd pull 20 plugs of lettuce or carrot or tomato seedlings, put them all in a plastic bag and sell them for 1€) and fruit trees.  I would've bought an orange tree for 7.50€ but it wouldn't fit in my suitcase.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WaDeENX_gJ-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/WaDeENX_gJ-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"a market stall selling live citrus trees.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>And finally, beside the farmer's market was a flea market;

			"content_html": "<p><em><a href=\"https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-magical-meeting-in-palmela/\">In our last episode</a>, our intrepid travellers embarked on an adventure full of distant train stations, steep switchbacks, and chance meetings with intensely interesting people.  But it was time to hit &quot;post&quot; and they were still on top of Castelo Palmela, trying to determine their next move.  Will they make it down in one piece?  Will Cindy ever see Setubol?  Will Mark get his mid-afternoon espresso?  Read on...</em></p>\n<p>It was getting toward 6pm and our amazing day in Palmela had to end. We were tired, footsore and hungry. Reluctantly, we made for the train station.</p>\n<p>But we were also feeling extra happy and brave, so we decided to take the gravel short cut back to the train station. Remember, it was on the map app, and we could see the path clear as day. So off we went, hand in hand. We were walking through the Portuguese countryside, just as we had dreamed, and if it was only for a few kilometres between towns that was just fine.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Our path below\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>What comes up must go down, right?</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Things got a little interesting though, when the map showed a fork in the road and we couldn't see the fork. Oh there it is - our route was no longer a road, but a walking path. Then a little further, it got smaller still, to a single bike track. Then the barbed wire fences and the 'Private Property' signs. (At least I think that's what they said, they were in Portuguese.) Soon, the muddy descent on a now washed out path. But the path is on an app! It has to be real! As we descended the hill, the fences kept narrowing towards us on the left and right. We were being funnelled to a point, but couldn't tell if there was a break in the fence at the point.  Just when I figured I'd have to boost Cindy over some barbed wire, there was a break in the fence so we didn't have to wreck our new travel clothes. At least not this time.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Mark on a very narrow path\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n \n<p>Finally, we were near some houses again. Gated estates, actually. With high walls and lots of noisy dogs, enraged at the intrusion on their domain by two tasty looking Canadians who straggled down the back of their property. Luckily, the path (which had now widened to a trail again) led between two of these estates and we nervously stumbled back onto the highway. Right near a McDonalds no less. We were in Aires again, and limped the final 2 km to the station relieved that we actually knew where we were going. No more map apps tonight.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wx79RK0Pln-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/wx79RK0Pln-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Nightfall\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Looking back up the hill. I looked easier from the top!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We stumbled on the train and headed back to Lisbon.  I was so tired.  I tried to watch the three young folks play cards beside us but could never figure out their game, and besides, I kept nodding off in the middle of the hand.  But I was also very, very hungry.  We resolved to find a place to eat between our metro station and the big hill right before our flat, no matter what.</p>\n<p>There was an interesting looking side alley just before the big hill that Cindy had wanted to check out all week, so this time we went down.  It quickly forked into two even smaller allies, with three restaurants all in a row (left side, middle point and right side.) Left side was too fancy; white tablecloths and black aprons.  The middle point looked really good, but only had empty tables outside, and we were too cold to eat outdoors tonight.</p>\n<p>Right side was different.  Colourful.  Lively music you could hear from the street.  Tables mostly full, but room indoors.  Menu on a chalkboard.  We figured why not and went inside. Called Tas'Ka, it looked like a coffee bar or lunch counter that had been repurposed to be  a restaurant.  But it sure smelled good.</p>\n<p>They serve African food that is representative of the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique.  It had only been open for a week and all the food was created and cooked by a lady we could watch from our seats. She was legit; cooking Real African Food,  just like mom and grandma.  At least according to Anna Dika, the lady seated beside us, who is without a doubt the biggest fan of Tas'Ka.</p>\n<p>Over the course of or meal, Anna helped us order and checked in on every course to make sure we liked it (we did.)  She was appalled that we were drinking water, so got us two glasses of wine so we could taste the food properly.  When we didn't order one of her favourite dishes, she made sure our waiter brought some by to taste.</p>\n<p>If that wasn't enough, it turned out that tonight was our waiter Clarence's birthday.  Anna and six or seven other people were at the restaurant to make sure Clarence was celebrating properly.  Cake was served.  Shots were poured.  Songs were sung, including Portuguese Happy Birthday, which we were lucky enough to know already (we learned the Brazilian version and it was close enough.) So we made two new friends and had cake too.</p>\n<p>Once our bellys were completely full, and Anna had filled my notebook with places to eat in Alentejo (our next destination), we were allowed to leave Tas'Ka.  We got back to our flat and were fast asleep in under 10 minutes, I'm sure.</p>\n<p>What a day! Other than seeing the castle in Palmela, we didn't do a single thing we had planned.  But we had a month's worth of adventures in a single day. That's what travel is all about - I just never thought it would happen to me.  But I really hoped it would.  I'm a lucky guy.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Cindy rousted me out of bed by 9:30 because we had a big day ahead of us. We were going to take our first train across the river and out of Lisbon. Just a short trip today. 40 minutes to Palmela and then 5 minutes further to Setubol. Palmela is known for its Medieval castle with amazing views so we definitely wanted to check that out.</p>\n<p>The train ticket process was a little confusing, but we had 20 minutes to figure it out before the train left. And we nailed it in 10. Every station has an information booth, but we've yet to see a booth with a person in it. Beside the booth is a kiosk with a few English words and far too many options. But there's often a helpful passenger to guide us.</p>\n<p>Travelling around the greater Lisbon area is actually really easy and very cheap.  There are lots of buses, four metro (subway) lines and the light rail trains to places like Sintra and Setubol.  And all work with a single &quot;Viva Viagem&quot; card.  You buy the card for 0.50€ and then load it up with money at kiosks around every station.  For the metro, you scan the card when you enter the station and again when you leave; the fee for the ride is then deducted from your card.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"The extremely useful Via Viagem card\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>The extremely useful Via Viagem card</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The challenge with trains is that you buy a specific fare at the kiosk, and you can't buy the fare if there are insufficient funds on the card.  So load the card, then buy the ticket.  But what if you don't know the fare?  You go in circles, endlessly looping around the kiosk menu, until the person behind you in line takes pity and tells you the fare.  4.15€ to Palmela.  And you can only by a one way ticket.  You can go through all this again at the Palmela station.</p>\n<p>Arriving in Palmela was hilarious, just like our trip to Belem. We looked out the window, saw the castle way off in the distance, and said &quot;hey, we must be getting close.&quot; Then the train stopped. It seems that Palmela station isn't actually in Palmela! It's more on the far side of Aires, the town beside the train tracks. The castle looked very far away indeed, but we figured we were in good shape, so we tightened our shoelaces and started trekking.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ru74n7xTiY-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ru74n7xTiY-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"The castle is far away, up a large hill\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>The castle is way up there?

My maps.me app didn't show any access other than the main highway, so we headed on up. The road was busy and the sidewalk got narrower and narrower as the road got steeper, first heading away from the castle then switching back toward it. At its steepest, the road narrowed so there was no sidewalk, then no curb! Just a concrete drain beside the busy road. So we took to the drain. After about an hour of this all told, we arrived at the Palmela cemetary, then a side road where we could duck into town. We jogged into town and into a wonderland.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\"Palmela\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Palmela is a medieval hillside village that is still active and vibrant today.

And hey, gravel roads are on my maps.me app too! More on that road later.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Looks like a shortcut\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Hmm.

I'm not kidding! We drank the wine (even Cindy, who never drinks red wine) and went over to thank the man, Tilak, and he introduced us to his daughter Rita and her partner Nuno. We visited a bit and Cindy show them her photo book of Regina life and then Tilak asked if we had 1/2 an hour and did we want to see more of the valley. Hell yeah! So we all piled into his 4x4 and drove out to the Barris Valley.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The valley is lived in and farmed but is also part of a protected area. The landowners and the government work together to keep the valley in its rural state even though there is pressure from Lisbon suburbs on one side an Setubal suburbs on the other. (As Tilak said, the government gives the protections and the landowners pay for everything.) But from the valley floor you forget about the cities on the other side of the hills. It's just wonderful country.</p>\n<p>Rita drove us over a hill and into the neighbouring Arrabida valley, where they lived. Tilak bought his place 35 years ago and has been slowly turning his piece of the hillside into what he calls a Mediterranean nature preserve. He's got plants from all over the world there that grow well in the hot Mediterranean climate. Aloe plants from his native Africa. Over 17 species of bamboo from his time working in Asia. All planted in and around the native cork trees and other native plants on his hillside acreage.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xr-fFFfse2-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/xr-fFFfse2-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Rita and Nuno's place.

 He kept his stack of plates together, barely, but asked us to take a seat after that.The coffee was even better than yesterday and the pastries were great too, but we'll try a new place tomorrow.  This one was so busy I was quite intimidated.</p>\n<p>And then further down the road to the Mercado da Ribeira, a large indoor market right by the train station, to pick up some fruit for the train ride.  According to our guidebooks, this is the main market, the Granville Island or Pike Place of Lisbon, if you will, but we must've got there late because there wasn't much going on.  Fruit, vegetable, flower, fish and meat vendors, to be sure, but no shoppers.</p>\n<p>The other half of the market was a series of restaurant booths.  Like a big food court but with really good looking food, all cooked in open kitchens.  It looked really nice, although all the cooks looked very serious indeed.  We didn't stop to eat as it wasn't noon yet and we had a train to catch.</p>\n<p>We're still getting used to the locals here, especially with regard to the weather.  By the time we reached the train station, which was right along the river, we were down to shirt sleeves.  The sun was out, the wind was calm and it was warm - already 15C.  One  cafe had beach chairs along the water and they were full up with tourists sunning themselves with drinks at hand.  But the locals?  Winter coats and scarves still.  I wonder when spring arrives for them?</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"198\" alt=\"deck chairs along the river\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption class=\"cluster font-display\"><p>Tourists sunning themselves beside the river.  The locals are still wearing winter clothes!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We were expecting a long ride.  The guidebook said 30 minutes by tram and a friend said 40 minutes.  So we made sure to grab nice seats and hunkered down for the ride.  The train was hot and stuffy.  I had a pretty good sweat going and started looking for a window to open but then looked around and everyone else had heavy coats and scarves on.  I guess it still wasn't warm enough.  So I did some Mark-style meditation and breathing exercises to slow my heart down and cool myself from the inside.</p>\n<p>The train rolled and we came up to one of the two big bridges that span the river.  This one looks a lot like the Golden Gate in San Francisco.  It towered over us and over the city as the freeway passed over the houses to meet the road half way up the hill.  As we went under the bridge, Cindy pointed out the spot where we took pictures of the aqueduct yesterday (the aqueduct goes over the freeway once it meets the hill.</p>\n<p>Then the train slowed down and we were at Belem station.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"384\" alt=\"Belem train station\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Huh?  We were on the train less than 5 minutes!  How can this be Belem?</p>\n<p>We got off, found a bench and checked the map.  Belem was not much more than 5km from our flat!  We had pretty much walked there yesterday and didn't know it!  I think what happened is that the 30-40 minute estimates were for trams.  Lots of stops and travelling though the hilly, narrow streets of Lisbon.  But the train is a straight shot on level ground.  Much, quicker.</p>\n<p>So, Belem.  Very, very nice.  Like, gorgeous!  The touristy bits of the area are all along the water and it's quite beautiful.</p>\n<p>First you have the river, with a nice walking promenade and an immense sculpture, the Tower of Belem.  The tower sticks out over the river like the prow of a Portuguese caravel, which is exactly the point.  The tower commemorates the Portuguese explorers who were among the very first to colonize much of Africa, Asia and South America (plus coming to Newfoundland too.)  These were the first fellows to bring the riches of the world &quot;home&quot; to the motherland.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/WMsVieNEhT-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/WMsVieNEhT-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" alt=\"Tower of Belem\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n  \n(That's going to be a common theme on this trip, I'm afraid, so I'll say it once and be done with it.  Vast riches were secured by a few people, often from colonies around the world.  These riches, and the people of the colonies too, were used to build the magnificent buildings Cindy and I will see all over the trip.  We're taught to feel guilty about all that today, or at least I do, even though we live in a former colony too.  But still.  These buildings and squares and statues are magnificent.  So I'm going to enjoy them.  End of downers...)\n<p>After the river comes a strip of beautiful, manicured parks.  Three in all, each with a central statue or fountain, smooth paths and lots and lots of benches.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Marble Fountain in Belem\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Beyond the parks is the Main Street, full of colourful houses, then full shops and bars, and then a splendid palace and museum.  The street was crowded with tourists (including these two from Saskatchewan) so we made one pass then moved inland, to stroll through the neighbourhood a little.  We found houses, the football stadium, then lots of gates and barbed wire.  There are several embassies in Belem, and we passed Austria, South Korea, Japan and Peru before we were back downtown.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"park with houses in distance\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>Belem is famous for a specific pastry, <em>pastel de nata</em>.  It is a custard tart, ideally served warm and was invented in Belem in 1837.  The shop that made the tart famous is still there and still making them. And even though you can buy <em>pastel de nata</em> in every <em>pasteleria</em> in Lisbon, there was a line out the door at this shop.  They've apparently done quite well in the past 175 years, since they now have a 400 seat restaurant to go with their takeout line.   We passed, then came back an hour later when the line was gone and bought two tarts plus a pair of duck and mushroom pastries for supper.  We ate them in the nearby park.  Delicious!  The custard is just slightly sweet and it is a real treat when still warm.  Well worth going to the source!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/0ZNhlEIubS-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/0ZNhlEIubS-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"286\" alt=\"Pasteis de Nata\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>After another stroll through the parks, we went back to Lisbon and up to the top of Parque Edouardo VII, which we enjoyed so much yesterday.  But instead of a side trip to aqueducts, we walked back to our flat down the middle - the Avenue de Libertadores.  Two large pedestrian promenades lined with shops so fancy I hadn't heard of most of them.  We stopped for my afternoon espresso and then took a quick left so Cindy could see one of the &quot;elevators&quot;, a tram on a track that goes up and down the steepest streets.  Wow, and I thought we'd been up some steep roads!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G9hxV-qVdk-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/G9hxV-qVdk-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Mark enjoying espresso\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>The elevator was at the foot of a magical series of narrow streets and alleyways known as the Restauradores district.  You guessed it.  Restaurants!  Theatres too.  The already narrow streets were full of tables.  Each group of tables had a waiter or restaurant owner with a menu to show to passers by.  &quot;Sir, look at my fish in the window!&quot;  &quot;Remember, our name is Santiago!&quot;  And some of the theatres had huge lines of kids camped out for tickets.  I couldn't figure out who was playing though.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-1280.avif 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-1280.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qi9Hb12ysH-1280.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png\" data-src=\"/img/qi9Hb12ysH-400.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"brightly painted apartments\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture></figure>\n<p>It was another long day of walking, so we grabbed a quick dinner, checked on the kids then went to bed before we could look at our pictures.  So this post will be a little late.  But we have another big day tomorrow so need to sleep!</p>\n",

breakfast like the locals: standing at the bar.  I had a delicious coffee and croissant while Cindy had fresh squeezed orange juice and a sausage pastry.  We were standing between a sweet old lady having the same coffee as me (I wasn't too shy to point and ask for what she was having) and a young businessman who was in an out while I was still figuring out what to order.</p>\n<p>I was over the moon happy.  I've been wanting to have a standup pastry &amp; espresso breakfast &quot;European style&quot; simply for ever.  I'm so glad Sabine used to have her coffee and croissant standing at our

two or three!</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/H3aBGUALgl-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/H3aBGUALgl-700.avif 700w,

some of the buildings.  As can be expected in an area that tight, it's a continuous line of 3-4 story row houses, with the walls coming to within 12-18 inches of the street.  Most of the time you couldn't walk two abreast without one person having to walk on the street.  But the best part was the tiles!  Many of the buildings were covered in traditional ceramic tiles making a colourful pattern on the wall.  Mostly they were just patterns but we saw one building with tiles making a scene across the whole wall.  I guess this is traditional Portuguese decoration for buildings, and it's beautiful.</p>\n<figure><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://markdyck.ca/img/9dN5g5YLzd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9dN5g5YLzd-700.avif 700w,

That's it for 3 months!</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>If there's one thing that every single travel guidebook mentions over and over is to PACK LIGHT!  Pack the bare minimum and leave half of that behind.  And really scrutinize the half you keep to see if you can take more weight off.</p>\n<p>There's something to that, you know.</p>\n<p>Our last &quot;Big Trip&quot; was two weeks to Vancouver, Seattle and Victoria in 2014 and that was a dry run on the whole &quot;carry everything on your back&quot; approach.  We borrowed travel packs that Ben and his buddies had taken to Europe.  Filled them to bursting, checked them at the airport, then swore every time we had to take the pack from the plane/train/ferry to our hostel.  It was brutal.</p>\n<p>This trip is much longer and we're going to visit many more places.  And that means more days lugging our packs.  I don't want to say 'lugging', even once.</p>\n<p>So, here's the plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One carry on sized, wheeled travel pack per person.</li>\n<li>One light day bag.</li>\n<li>Minimal, easy to wash, quick to dry clothes</li>\n<li>Very little paper (my books and journals often weigh more than my clothes!</li>\n<li><strong>10kg (22lb) limit per person.</strong> 9kg is better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The weight limit is really important.

I still wish it was a little less.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Bag:</strong> Last year I invested in a really good carry-on sized wheeled backpack, the <a href=\"http://www.ospreypacks.com/ca/en/product/meridian-convertible-60l-22-MERIDN22_726.html\">Osprey Meridian</a>, based on the recommendation of the very smart owner of <a href=\"http://www.robinsonsoutdoors.com/\">Robertson Outdoor Store</a> in Victoria.  She travels the world, from Poland to Peru and the Meridian is the only bag she takes.</p>\n<p>One cool feature is the Meridian comes with a zip off daypack.  When the daypack is off, the big bag meets carry-on restrictions.  Zipped on, I can wheel or carry everything in one streamlined unit.</p>\n<p>I've taken a few small trips with my Meridian and it's a dream as a wheeled bag.  This will be the first trip where I use it as a backpack too; I'm curious to see the proportion of wheeled use vs. backpack use.</p>\n<p><strong>Clothes:</strong> I'm really trying to conserve weight here.  Lightweight pants, 3 shirts, socks and underwear, 1 pair shorts and 1 pair swim trunks.  A fleece and a raincoat.  Shoes and sandals.  We're going in spring so thankfully won't have to carry a heavy coat and mitts, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Electronics:</strong> The splurge (money and weight) is my iPad and keyboard setup.  I've got travel guides and maps pre-loaded, plus I can blog on the road and FaceTime home too.  It's worth the weight.  Lots of cables and electrical adapters making the trip too, though.</p>\n<p>Cindy's carrying her point and shoot camera.  We've got an adapter to hook the camera up to the iPad so we can share pictures from the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Paper:</strong> I can't get to zero, but I am being strict here.  Two bundles of <a href=\"http://fieldnotesbrand.com/\">Field Notes</a> books for journalling/lists, a watercolour sketchbook, a travelling paint set, pens, pencils and brushes.  I am extremely tempted to take a second sketchbook but will fill the first one and buy another instead!</p>\n<p>Cindy made her own travel guide / journal from the pile of guidebooks we borrowed from the library and is still holding out hope that <a href=\"http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp\">Patrick Rothfuss</a> finally publishes his new novel before we get to Paris.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Bits:</strong> I'm banking on Europeans shaving and brushing their teeth, so am taking minimal toiletries.  I'll buy more when I run out.  And we always seem to collect plastic cutlery, etc. when we picnic, so I'll get a spork for the next adventure.  A lightweight pack towel was my only splurge here.</p>\n<p>And it wouldn't be a Mark and Cin trip without our Gin Rummy book and a deck of cards.  We've had a running game going since 1990 or so.  :)</p>\n<p>That's it.  It all fits in the carry-on bag with lots of room to spare.  But hows the weight?</p>\n<p><strong>Total Weight</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mark's bag: 23lbs (10.4kg)</strong> Argh.  Too many Field Notes?  Too many socks? That iPad+Keyboard put me over the limit a touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Cindy's bag: 21lbs (9.5kg)</strong> Pretty darn good.  She can carry the toiletry bag.</p>\n<p>Time will tell.  If we're carrying the packs a lot and it's too much, we can either chuck some stuff, mail it home, or get in better shape...</p>\n",

(Expect southern Spain to be packed Easter week.)  When are any cool festivals we want to see?</li>\n<li>I used pencil and sticky tabs to block out week long blocks, going forward and backwards.  At the start of the trip, we want to have time to visit more of Portugal than Lisbon, so that gets two weeks.  At the end, we want time to cycle in the Netherlands, so that gets a week.  We want to linger in Paris on route to Holland, so another week there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first run through is like a filled chocolate:  semi-firm on top and bottom, but soft and gooey in the middle.  For example, we really have no clue how we'll make our way from northern Italy to Paris, although we know we'd like to be in Paris by May 10 at the latest.  And we know that if May is approaching and we're nowhere near Veneto, we had better re-think things.</p>\n<p>As we read through guidebooks and get ideas from our friends, things may firm up a bit.  What's happening so far is that we're finding more and more things we want to see. That will increase for sure once we land in a few weeks.  But there are a few people we want to visit so it's good to at least commit to the month that we'll be in their country!</p>\n<p>Our approach is to go slow and deep into the places we visit, so the lack of a fixed itinerary will help with this.  We'll need to make a lot of decisions as we go, but that's part of the fun.</p>\n<p>We already know we won't have enough time to see everything we want on this trip.   Unless we sell the house.  Our kids have instructions of what to do if we call with the &quot;sell&quot; code.</p>\n",

Lonely Planet might be a good fit but isn't available at the library much so I haven't formed an opinion.</p>\n<p>WIth our 'go deep' strategy, the individual country or region guides (Portugal, Paris, Andalucia) are a better match than Europe in 500 pages.  The regional books have room for smaller, quirkier places in addition to the big names.</p>\n<p>The &quot;general overview&quot; books have been helpful too.  Rough Guide's &quot;First Time Europe&quot; or Rick Steve's &quot;Europe Through the Back Door&quot; get you in the right frame of mind for travelling, rather than talking about where to eat and what to see.</p>\n<p>But all this book smarts can only give us the basics of a region.  I can hardly wait to get there and see Europe with my own eyes, meet new people, and follow my nose.</p>\n",
