		<title>Rise Up! #186 - Sage Dilts and Nathan Hodges</title>

Both on their farm on Lopez Island.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to an island in the Pacific Northwest is not easy.  Moving intentionally, with a view of contributing to the community is even more difficult.  But Sage Dilts and Nathan Hodges have done just that with their farm and bakery on Lopez Island, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an awesome talk, ranging from when Sage and Nathan met in grad school in the Bay Area, where Sage developed her baking chops, how they found their way to Lopez Island and how the locals embraced their quest to make the best bread from the localist grains.  And how Barn Owl Bakery is feeding their village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Scott and other mentors make recurring appearances in the journey, as a mentor and guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listened to our conversation again, I was struck by how important it was to Sage and Nathan to give something to their new community, rather than simply move in and enjoying the natural beauty.  They&#39;re both committed to making the earth a better place and they&#39;re doing it through service.  I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&#39;t take my word for it!  Listen for yourself below.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read an article today where scientists claim that your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/05/short-term-memory-illusions-study.&quot;&gt;memories can start changing in three seconds&lt;/a&gt;  No sh*t, Sherlock.  I think it&#39;s quicker than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bent out of shape last week over some chocolate croissants.  No more than 15 chocolate croissants.  I wanted to help out and shape them and was encouraged not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was heard, according to me, was that I don&#39;t shape them well and it would be easier for someone else to do it than show me what my technique lacked.  And that I was a simple, fat hairy oaf who smelled bad, talked odd and had literal sausages for fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was said, according to the speaker, was that I had already done more than expected, was looking tired and hey, why not head on home and we&#39;ll go again tomorrow.  Can I make you lunch before you go?  And by the way, have you lost weight?  You&#39;re looking pretty good these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was ACTUALLY said?  Who knows?  The entire conversation could be recorded, we could both listen to it and still hear the two conversations above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given that nothing is real, what are we to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give more grace.  Lots more grace.  To me.  To you.  To us and them and everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good, bad or neutral, we heard it wrong.  And &lt;em&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; a scientific fact.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Serendipity, emails and rabbit holes have taken me far, far down Memory Lane today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got an email from my friend Mar, who I haven&#39;t talked to in a few years.  She was thinking about Hot Cross Buns and how, that first Easter when we opened Orange Boot Bakery, we turned her partner Bruce away empty handed at least three times on the Saturday before Easter.  We just didn&#39;t know how to hold orders yet.  After we closed we took the last dozen buns (which I think were reserved for Cindy&#39;s mom), looked up their address and brought them to the house.  It&#39;s been 12 years and they haven&#39;t forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we got to chatting and Mar reminded me of the name Beth Traynor, who ran an awesome little catering business out of a small shop on Robinson and 13th Avenue.  Beth made the best carrot cake (among other delicious food).   She even made the carrot cake for our wedding over 30 years ago and I was sad to forget her name, and glad to now remember it again.  Beth&#39;s long since retired and she is still missed in Regina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other news, my search of personal website inspiration (that I might &#39;steal&#39; for this site) took me to a brand new  (to me) website by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carolynzhang.com/&quot;&gt;Carolyn Zhang&lt;/a&gt;.  She wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carolynzhang.com/2020/introduction&quot;&gt;a masterful pair of essays&lt;/a&gt; on her experience designing campaign software on the fly for the 2020 US election and how the experience affected her personally. Wow.  Deep reflection on how doing work that matters to you often conflicts with internal narratives that have built up over a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - my personal website &#39;research&#39; also took me to a blog that I read 20 years ago and haven&#39;t been to in over 15.  It&#39;s still going strong. What a thrill thrill to dig through the archives and remember what I was reading before my baking life.  Then, sadly, I read the new stuff.  Let&#39;s just say that he didn&#39;t seem to be such a crank in 2004.  I shall not be sharing a link.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Five Bits of Gratitude</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/five-bits-of-gratitude/"/>
		<updated>2023-04-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/five-bits-of-gratitude/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another habit that needs reinforcing.  It&#39;s too easy to slide into dark talk when in actual fact, there is much good in the world, and much good inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five of those good things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The massive dark cloud which seems to frame The Empress Hotel most evenings dissipated in time for the most brilliant spring sunset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry trees and magnolias are in bloom all over Victoria, which make my walks to and from work magical.  I&#39;m so lucky to live in this beautiful city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cindy made pancakes!  Which is excellent full stop.  But triply so because tomorrow is a &#39;wheat day&#39; for my elimination / re-integration diet, so I shall be having leftover pancakes for breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22571656&quot;&gt;The Happiness Equation&lt;/a&gt; which Cin found in a Free Little Library box and I had left in the back bedroom.  Upon re-opening, the first thing I read reminded me that &lt;em&gt;I love working on teams&lt;/em&gt; and that teamwork is very important to me.  Which is lacking at UP.  We get along, but we&#39;re not a team.  Or I&#39;m not feeling it.  Glad I remembered something that&#39;s important to me but currently lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question on B4B has reminded me how difficult but amazing Easter baking was at Orange Boot.  And it follows on that...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakers4Bakers is a good place.  I&#39;m grateful for the people who share and learn and grow there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<title>Signals and Worldviews</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/signals-and-worldviews/"/>
		<updated>2018-10-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/signals-and-worldviews/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As represented by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MINISTER of Agriculture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hereinafter referred to as “THE MINISTRY”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-and-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Dyck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hereinafter referred to as “THE SERVICE PROVIDER”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been discussing &amp;quot;signals&amp;quot; quite a bit in over in &lt;a href=&quot;https://therightcompany.co&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Right Company&lt;/a&gt;  community. From the price you set to the metaphors you employ to the typeface you use in your newsletters, every item you send out in the world sends a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, each signal runs through a filter before it is received. And that filter is the worldview of the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six page contract that came last week for a 30 minute presentation I&#39;d agreed to give (in exchange for gas money) is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my single worldview drew out three distinct reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a power play! They&#39;re just trying to push me down a peg. Service Provider - pfft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about bureaucracy! It cost them more to create the contract than the gas money. All for a 30 minute talk. What a waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That poor lady. She must be embarrassed to have to send me such a crazy contract for a tiny thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure you can think of more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the contract itself isn&#39;t good or bad. A verbal agreement would create just as many reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question for us as leaders, storytellers and marketers isn&#39;t &amp;quot;should I use a contract?&amp;quot; It&#39;s not even &amp;quot;how will people respond to this signal?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more important question is &amp;quot;How will a person with the worldview I&#39;m trying to connect with react to this signal?&amp;quot; Others will react differently and that&#39;s OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arises when we send a signal and are surprised by the response.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/belonging/"/>
		<updated>2018-10-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/belonging/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;belonging&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Belonging &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/belonging/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:/sethgodin.com&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; has a new course out. This one is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticketbud.com/events/be3192fc-a2da-11e8-a062-c3808af35729&quot;&gt;podcasting.&lt;/a&gt; He announced it this morning and I already have the signup page in front of me, with the cursor hovering over the submit button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month ago, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebootstrappersworkshop.com/&quot;&gt;the Bootstrapper&#39;s workshop.&lt;/a&gt; The month before that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://themarketingseminar.com/&quot;&gt;the Marketing Seminar&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://altmba.com/&quot;&gt;the altMBA&lt;/a&gt; (which I actually took.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about me and Seth&#39;s projects that makes me want to drop all my work and join up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not the information, although it&#39;s relevant and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often it&#39;s not even filling a knowledge gap. I mean, I just shipped &lt;a href=&quot;http://riseuppod.com/rise-up-29-ontario-trip-report-arlo-brandl&quot;&gt;my 29th podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning. And I&#39;m already bootstrapping three projects. I know how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Seth is the master of connection. I&#39;m desperate to meet the other people who sign up for the session. To see what they are making. To help them succeed. To be part of a larger cohort of bootstrappers, of marketers, of podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, to be part of &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; cohort of bootstrappers, marketers and podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because what Seth has built over the years is a reputation of doing things a certain way. With purpose, clarity and generosity. I want to build the same reputation, as do the others he attracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People like us.&lt;/em&gt; That&#39;s what we all want. And Seth has brought us together once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m not signing up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I want to, &lt;em&gt;yearn to&lt;/em&gt;, I&#39;m not going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&#39;s my lizard brain, my Resistance, that is screaming at me to press the sign up button this morning. It knows that if I sign up, I&#39;ll be &#39;all in&#39; for the next six weeks, spending hour after hour in the new group, with my new friends, helping them go forward. And I&#39;ll spend six weeks describing, in great detail, how I want to move forward too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that feels so, so, good. I want it so badly. But I know that it will delay me from actually moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://riseuppod.com&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; will stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://prospercity.org&quot;&gt;ProsperCity&lt;/a&gt; will stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://therightcompany.co&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Right Company&lt;/a&gt; will stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my Backyard Bakery will stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be back in Dream mode instead of Ship mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have to say no. I must, respectfully, decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is soooo difficult to do, but it&#39;s the right call for now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Using The Gift</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/using-the-gift/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/using-the-gift/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t had the most productive week.  Well, I got things done, but not the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the week to send out invitations for my next project, but to do that meant standing up and sharing my intentions with people I admire.  To say &amp;quot;This is what I&#39;m doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I hid.  Let the week slide by.  At one point, I even told myself that my friends would refuse my invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I talked about this and she reminded me that every day is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in this unique position where (for a while anyway) I can spend my time working on projects that I chose, rather than projects that others choose for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a day not spent moving my projects forward is a waste of my gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have this gift.  A day, a week, or maybe only an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t waste the gift.  The world needs what you&#39;re making.  Please use the time you have.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The End Of The Week</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-end-of-the-week/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-end-of-the-week/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been deep in a post altMBA funk this week. I&#39;ve got my project plan and my task list but I&#39;m just not working at it enough to ship on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted by being stuck like this, especially when it&#39;s self inflicted, my first reaction is that my deadlines are soft. Or at least out too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the altMBA format is that there is something due every single day. So there&#39;s nowhere to hide. No way to get around to it later. You gotta ship, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us, me included, like to set weekly goals. I&#39;ll ship by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Monday quickly turns into Tuesday turns into Wednesday. Laundry is done, the house is (relatively) clean, groceries purchased, side projects tended to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as the sun sets on Thursday night, you realize you haven&#39;t really got going on The Big Project. The one with the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s when the downward spiral picks up steam. The funk gets funkier. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, better to have a daily deadline and mean it. Promise yourself you&#39;ll pay the neighbour (the one you don&#39;t like that much) $20 if you don&#39;t ship tonight. And tomorrow. And the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a stack of twenties and put them on your desk as a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then get to work. We need you to ship.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Secret Path</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-secret-path/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-secret-path/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been fixating on the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gorddownie.com/&quot;&gt;Gord Downie&lt;/a&gt; for a month now, since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gord-downie-obit-1.4359906&quot;&gt;his untimely passing in October&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday I started watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://watch.cbc.ca/the-secret-path/-/gord-downies-secret-path-in-concert/38e815a-00d2808347a&quot;&gt;CBC broadcast of The Silent Path&lt;/a&gt;, the concert / album / film / graphic novel about a boy who ran away from a residential school in 1966 and died trying to walk the 600km home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I had to stop after two songs. I was crying too much. Listening to the songs performed live, with the film playing in the background was heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to watch the whole thing this weekend. It&#39;s important that we all do, to help us understand what went on and start to comprehend the magnitude of the reconciliation that&#39;s required. As Gord himself says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gorddownie.com/news/secret-path-acceptance-message/&quot;&gt;in this moving speech&lt;/a&gt;, it took seven generations to get to this point and will take seven generations to fully heal. But it&#39;s time to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t recommend this concert enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS.  Some more links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0uqo6tAla0jJZQA1H4OdLK&quot;&gt;The Secret Path&lt;/a&gt; album on Spotify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gord&#39;s last album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/4P8bXg1idWXE5rsmW4lKGs&quot;&gt;Introduce Yerself&lt;/a&gt; announced just weeks prior to his death, on Spotify&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Get</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about the new Bread tome called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Modernist-Bread-Science-Nathan-Myhrvold/dp/0982761058/&quot;&gt;Modernist Bread&lt;/a&gt; and asked if anyone had any pull at the public library.  (Well, or with Santa Claus too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent a similar question to my Backyard Bakery buddies and it turns out that one of the Bread Buddies does in fact work at the library and close to the circulation department no less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;a href=&quot;http://reginalibrary.ca&quot;&gt;RPL&lt;/a&gt; is ordering a set of books for their collection.  Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt they&#39;ll be reference material, for in library use only, but I&#39;ll gladly spend a few afternoons checking them out.  And with their excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sasklibraries.ca/about.html&quot;&gt;province wide circulation system&lt;/a&gt;, my baking friends in Saskatoon will be able to use them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the moral of the story is to actually ask for what you want, out loud.  Good things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you bake, make sure your librarians have access to your bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if I could only do that with my podcast!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Christmas List</title>

According to my mailbox and the 25 pounds of flyers I received last week, it is officially Christmas Season.  Time to string up the lights (we string ours indoors because I&#39;m scared of heights) and go hunting for a tree (conifer preferred.)
&lt;p&gt;So I guess it&#39;s not too early to publish my Christmas List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is easy.  A book.  A Bread Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it&#39;s a 6 volume, 2600 page, $550 bread book, but still...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s called &lt;em&gt;Modernist Bread: Art and Science&lt;/em&gt;.  It&#39;s also legitimately a tome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know too much about the author, other than he&#39;s a former Microsoft employee who is more than rich enough to nerd out on food.  Or in the case of this book, bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read an article on the author / book today and the books seem really interesting.  One entire volume is about the farmer-miller-baker supply chain, which I find fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have any pull with the Big Guy - either Mr. Claus or the Head of Circulation at Regina Public Library - please put in a good word for me.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>More on Shipping</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/more-on-shipping/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Cindy and Ben working and Robyn in Calgary, this Sunday was actually a good time to keep working on my next project. I thrashed for an hour or two before I had to stop and figure out what was bugging me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times I get so eager to get moving forward that I start in the middle and start writing. That&#39;s fine up to a point but sooner or later I need to step back and reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where the &lt;strong&gt;Shipit Journal&lt;/strong&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth created the journal several years ago as a way to document the fears around projects right at the start, so you could call them out and then deal with them. It&#39;s also a good way to look at your project from several angles so that you can identify everything that needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was starting the &#39;doing&#39; without really identifying all the pieces that needed to get done. So my head was full of ideas for other stages of the project. And a cluttered mind doesn&#39;t do great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took an hour and filled in the Shipit Journal from front to back. It was well worth it - even though this is a solo project, I was able to identify several areas where I could get some outside help. Plus, I wrote down all the areas of the project that needed good planning and design, from the pre-launch through to finding sponsors and partners. All in one little booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, Seth made these booklets in 5 packs so your whole team could fill them in. But they are out of print. I was lucky to get a paper copy as part of my altMBA package, which is photocopiable. (new word!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/theshipitjournal.pdf&quot;&gt;free PDF version online&lt;/a&gt;, which is what I used. I still can&#39;t bring myself to write in a book. Sigh...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Remembrance Day</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/remembrance-day/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the 99th anniversary of Armistice Day in World War I. Too long ago to have surviving veterans, but not too long to go without remembering their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I went down to the Cenotaph for the wreath laying ceremony, like we do every year. And as in most years, there were several hundred people braving the snow and cold to pay respect to our veterans and hope for lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, I get a little more conflicted by the ceremony. Not conflicted by why I&#39;m there, but conflicted by the ceremony itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our society changes and gets more inclusive, following the pattern of a Christian church service seems more and more out of place. How do the Sikh&#39;s (who fought and who laid a wreath) feel about all the Jesus references, for example.  Or the Muslims who&#39;s ancestors also fought in the World Wars? Can I be an atheist or a Buddhist or a Hindu and still feel a core part of the ceremony?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to their credit, the Legion ceremony has changed quite a bit over the years. But things seem to have been taken out andm not replaced. So the entire event seems shorter each year, which is a shame, even in the snow and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if we could honour our war veterans on this day and also pledge to work for peace and understanding throughout the world. To invite all groups to lay a wreath, including First Nations, LGBT veterans, all religions and immigrant groups. So we can all say &#39;Thank You&#39;, &#39;We Remember&#39; and &#39;Never, Ever Again.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony talks a lot about how our veterans defended freedom. I&#39;m all for that. And to me, freedom means diversity. We need more of that too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Generosity</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/generosity/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/generosity/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying really hard to be generous with the backyard bakery.  Making extra large loaves, being accommodating around special requests and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I&#39;m my own worst enemy.   Take this week for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted out of baking on Saturday because that&#39;s Remembrance Day.  I don&#39;t want to be working that day - it&#39;s a day for veterans and for peace.  So I moved the second bake day to Sunday instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing is, nobody was ordering for Sunday.  Maybe 20 loaves total, spread across 5 kinds.  4 Seeded Rye.  2 Pain de Campagne.  1 demi baguette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crazy.  It&#39;s a waste of wood to get the brick oven hot for 3 half bakes.  And how do I even mix a single 300g baguette?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I cancelled Sunday&#39;s bake, but offered to bake the bread on Friday along with the Friday orders.  Friday wasn&#39;t so big; one extra bake will cover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I forgot about the varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m off to bed early tonight, because tomorrow I have 10 mixes to do.  Granted, some are quite small (those 10 mixes will cover 5 bakes) but it&#39;s going to be a pretty hairy day to keep everything straight and hopefully have everything proof at a predictable rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know what?  That&#39;s the point of the whole project.  To be generous.  To go the extra mile for people.  So I&#39;m not complaining, even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to waste wood (hence cancelling Sunday) but I also won&#39;t disappoint my bread buddies.  So I&#39;ve made good notes, double checked all the labels on my little preferment containers and will give it an honest go in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep you posted...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Shipping Matters</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/shipping-matters/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/shipping-matters/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best things of &lt;a href=&quot;http://altmba.com/&quot;&gt;the altMBA&lt;/a&gt; course is that we were forced to ship a new thing every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either a project, or good feedback on other projects, or reflections on the feedback we received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn&#39;t think I could do it, especially around my other work. I was literally spinning around trying to get myself under control. Scrambling to make every deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the first week, I got my feet under me and fell into a sort of rhythm. I had &#39;work time&#39; and &#39;home time&#39; and &#39;altMBA time.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what, not only did everything get done, but it got done well. Or at least, good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;shipping-is-more-important-than-perfection&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Shipping is More Important Than Perfection &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/shipping-matters/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson is that you&#39;re better off shipping something on time rather than getting it perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ll never hit perfect anyway. It&#39;s just a stall tactic in your head to avoid the vulnerability of shipping something real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The longer you wait, the longer you avoid getting feedback. This is no good. Quality feedback will change your work anyway, or at least your ideas. Better to ship and get that feedback quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing dates is addictive. It&#39;s too easy to miss your second date. So don&#39;t miss even one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imperfect-is-not-garbage&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Imperfect Is Not Garbage &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/shipping-matters/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a difference between shipping crap and shipping imperfect work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I define &#39;crap&#39; as dishonest, shallow, or purposefully vague work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Imperfect&#39; is still honest, deep, thoughtful work. Maybe it&#39;s not 100% complete, or could benefit from some generous feedback, but the core is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you need to keep polishing, just ship. Get the feedback then ship again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Avoiding the Hard Part</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/avoiding-the-hard-part/"/>
		<updated>2017-11-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/avoiding-the-hard-part/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sat at my computer this morning and started fretting almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still early. The sun wasn&#39;t even up over the houses across the street. But I knew I needed to work on my podcast. It&#39;s my Big Project. I need to ship something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I do today? (Project work is in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start revising the concept and goals for the podcast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a cup of coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a stewing hen doing its thing in the slow cooker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brainstorm show names.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at logo sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email by buddy about making the show logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worry about this weekend&#39;s bake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a reminder email about this weekend&#39;s bake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a letter to a friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for a walk and mail the letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surf YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check email again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once more through Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start thinking about supper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write this post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly focused on my Big Project, am I? What&#39;s happening here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m running away from the tension. Avoiding the hard part. In general terms, I&#39;m hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing is that I can&#39;t sit still long enough to figure out what the hard part actually &lt;em&gt;is!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m definitely avoiding something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-the-daily-micro-habit&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Introducing the Daily Micro Habit &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/avoiding-the-hard-part/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding the hard part is expected behaviour. It&#39;s an automatic response from the ancient lizard brain. So the key is to notice the avoidance, then trick the lizard and get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where the Daily Micro Habit comes in. What&#39;s the new habit that you&#39;ll repeat 100 times a day if needed to notice when you&#39;re hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote my podcast goal down, I wrote this as the habit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll make progress by keeping daily office hours, which I&#39;ll track. Typically they will be in the mornings, Monday - Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each evening, I&#39;ll take a quick reflection on the day to make sure I&#39;ve kept my promise for office hours and will set a mini-goal for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so bad. I&#39;m not blocking time and I&#39;m not reflecting either. I may need extra medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I see the problem. That&#39;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bittersweet Mystery Boxes</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/bittersweet-mystery-boxes/"/>
		<updated>2017-09-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/bittersweet-mystery-boxes/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve mentioned before that I&#39;m a stamp collector.  The collecting bug ebbs and flows within me; over my life I&#39;ve collected records, books, hockey cards, Panini stickers and football scarves.  But postage stamps have been a consistent joy.  I collected as a boy and got back into it around the time Ben was born in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with saying I&#39;m a stamp collector (aside from denting my public persona as a rough and rugged outdoorsman) is that people often ask me what areas I collect.  That&#39;s a tough question for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really love about collecting is going through mystery boxes.  These are random envelopes, cigar boxes, or Rubbermaid tubs full of stamps, album pages and old envelopes. Quite often, these boxes are sold more by weight than a detailed assessment of what&#39;s inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love sorting through these boxes and discovering what&#39;s inside.  It&#39;s the anticipation that&#39;s the fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention all this because I spent my Sunday with Cindy and her sisters, cleaning out her parent&#39;s garage.  I got the same weird thrill even though no stamps were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time the experience was a little sad too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris and Carol have lived in their house for 47 years and they&#39;ll be there for several years yet.  But as Chris gets older, he can no longer do the things he used to, so his cluttered garage is no longer the treasured work space I&#39;ve come to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his prime, Chris could make anything.  He&#39;s a great mechanic.  He used to work on the trains for CN.  He owned a concrete company and could fix anything in the yard, from the loaders to the concrete plant to the trucks.  In the winter, when the plant was closed, he would rebuild the huge round drums of the concrete trucks, sometimes building a new drum from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris could fix any car and was especially talented at body work.  He&#39;s incredibly, infuriatingly patient, so that a new paint job would take forever but would be 100% perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also an accomplished woodworker, carpenter and cabinet maker.  Since I&#39;ve known Cindy, he rebuilt his kitchen once and his cabinet fronts twice.  Gutted and rebuilt our kitchen too.  He added two new rooms to his house, completely renovated the Rectory at the Cathedral, did a ton of work on the Girl Guides building, drove our garage to our yard in one piece like a parade float, and also built several &#39;Reapers Inn&#39; haunted houses for Halloween back in the &#39;90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could make pretty much anything out of wood, metal or concrete, including the tools needed to make other things. He made his own table saw out of steel and a lathe out of railway ties.  Very stable machines, those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over the past few years, Chris has lost his legendary powers of concentration, so he can&#39;t do the detailed work any more.  Which frustrated him to no end.  So it&#39;s time to clean out the garage and move the tools on to new homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning the garage is a huge undertaking.  The sisters have been at it two days and there&#39;s likely two more days to go.  We&#39;ve been finding box after box of all kinds of things.  Could be a brand new set of cabinet router bits.  A set of impact wrench sockets.  Wood turning gouges.  Pail after pail of wrenches, screwdrivers and tin snips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even found a car differential in a black plastic garbage bag.  Could be from a Ford, or possible a Dodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collector in me had a huge amount of fun.  I was seeking out the strangest of the boxes to go through. What&#39;s that tiny blue metal box?  The larger red plastic one?  What&#39;s in the metal canister that originally held 4 lbs of chicken soup stock?  Delightful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was bittersweet too.  Chris was there, helping us go through everything and explaining what the stranger tools were used for.  As powerful as it was to relive a lifetime worth of projects and accomplishments, it was so sad to see the projects that were still unfinished or in the planning stages and now wouldn&#39;t be started.  If only the tools were still in his hands, rebuilding a &#39;55 Tbird or building a set of cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s the cycle of life, eh?  Tools get passed on and new people build new things (and while it&#39;s a lame parallel, so do stamps.) We don&#39;t really own anything, we just get to use them for a little while.  Heck, there will come a time (hopefully in the very distant future) when someone else will be using the brick oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s celebrate whatever it is we can do today, whether it&#39;s art or music or teaching or cooking or strategic planning, and do the heck out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#39;ll be fully in tune while I&#39;m baking this week, using my tools to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Work Like An Egyptian</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/work-like-an-egyptian/"/>
		<updated>2017-07-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/work-like-an-egyptian/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our shed&#39;s had quite the history. We built this 4&#39; x 8&#39;, half gable contraption from a kit purchased from Beaver Lumber more than 25 years ago. Before we were married even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built it out at the farm, because I was young and still held my father&#39;s carpentry skills in high regard. Here was a man who, when I was a boy, finished his own basement, built his own garage and poured several driveways and patios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I had made a knife block out of 2x4&#39;s in Junior Achievement, which collapsed within months. Plus a wooden sign inscribed &amp;quot;DYCK&amp;quot; in wavy black letters, made in my high school shop class. Mom and Dad said the sign was too large to hang outside our front door, although my younger sister&#39;s identical sign (made the following year) held a place of honour in Regina and later at the farm for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of shed building however, I started to wonder if Dad was out of practice. Ignoring the instruction sheet, he insisted in building the shed in exactly the opposite order. Cuts within an inch and a half of the line seemed just fine to him. So long as we reinforced everything with Dad&#39;s favourite device, 3 inch spiral Ardox nails, he figured it would hold together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hours into this two hour project, Cindy had enough, grabbed the instructions and insisted we start over. This time, by the book. Dad relented and followed Cin&#39;s directions and the shed was complete before nightfall. Then we loaded it in the back of Dad&#39;s truck and drove it to our the back of our rented apartment on Retallack Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On the drive to Regina, Dad asked me why we bothered building the shed at the farm, because he was a &amp;quot;wood butcher.&amp;quot; It turns out his friend Bob was the true carpenter. I forgot how Bob was involved with Dad&#39;s garage and basement projects.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the shed fit between the wheel wells of an old half ton truck, we took it with us when we moved to Wascana Street. Cindy and the kids decorated it up and stored all the kid&#39;s toys in it for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the kids got older, we moved the shed to the back of the yard and put our garden tools in it. Then planted two apple trees around it and pretty much ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice didn&#39;t ignore the shed though. Over the years we&#39;ve been having a running battle over who gets to live in the shed. 20 year old particle board is pretty easy to gnaw through, I guess. It was time to either start using the shed again or get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re going to take side wall off and turn the shed into an open air wood storage bin for the micro-bakery. But first we needed to move it closer to the oven. On Sunday. In the +35C heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn invited two of her friends over with vague promises of ice cream and along with Cindy and myself, we got to work. Robyn thought we only had to move the thing two feet, so more promises had to be made once she realized the true distance. But she hung in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told the crew that we were going to move the shed just like the Egyptians built the Pyramids - with lots and lots of leverage. And for the most part, we did. We laid a series of boards end to end, then levered up a corner of the shed high enough to slide round bars between the shed and the boards. Then pushed like hell and tried to roll this rotten, crumbly monstrosity across the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pretty much worked. Much of the underside of the shed was rotting away, so instead of rolling, the round bars would fall into a rotting divot. But we were able to roll it 1-2 feet before stopping and resetting the apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 or 25 roll and reset cycles and the shed was in its new home. The only casualties were a branch from one apple tree, a bit of the lawn where the boards gouged a path and about 20% of the undercarriage of the shed, which tore off on the journey. Not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my wallet took a pretty big hit too. Ice cream is more expensive than I thought. Must be the PST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I had to promise that this is the shed&#39;s final resting place. Seems fair.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Resilience</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My dad turned 79 years old yesterday, which is pretty remarkable. There&#39;s not much more that can go wrong with his body; at this point in his life, he&#39;s all bones and gristle. He&#39;s had multiple bypasses, half a lung gone from cigarettes, a couple fused vertebrae, stomach surgery, hiatus hernia surgery, rotator cuff surgery and a stroke, but he keeps on going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s still living in the my maternal grandparent&#39;s farmhouse on 10 acres south of Moose Jaw and he&#39;s planting his usual 1/2 acre vegetable garden this year. (He doesn&#39;t eat vegetables other than potatoes but loves to grow them all.) His only compromise to age is the rows get a little further apart, so he can better see the plants from the weeds. The stroke messed his eyesight up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My buddy Giacomo and I went out to see dad last week. Giacomo bought an old Chevy camper van last year for his cross Canada adventure this summer and stored it in dad&#39;s Quonset for the winter. He and his partner Martina, who are immigrating to Canada from Italy, are selling everything they own and driving coast to coast this summer. They want to see as much of their new country as possible before deciding where to settle down. With the weather warming up he&#39;s excited to get the van packed and hit the road right after Easter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we drove out to Moose Jaw and I did my best to give Jack a minor history lesson about all the times Saskatchewan got settled and what the Hudson Bay Company was all about and why he should check out Batoche and learn about the Riel Rebellion and what&#39;s Treaty 4 and why we talk about it now when we never did when I was a kid. Lest he think Saskatchewan wasn&#39;t as interesting as Tofino or Cape Breton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the farm, dad showed Jack his arrowhead collection before we went out and started up the van. Dad was complaining about his shoulder though (the one with the rotator cuff surgery,) which hasn&#39;t been the same since his neighbour&#39;s cow yanked on it a couple of years back. It was causing him a lot of pain from mounting the birdhouse on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birdhouse, I asked? Yeah, the one on the 14 foot pole by the house. Dad built a new birdhouse with eight little entrances out of an old wooden crate after the old one blew down last year. It&#39;s very fashionable, with the same flat roof that seems to be all the rage in Regina infills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Johnny (the neighbour) came over with his front end loader and, since Johnny (who&#39;s young, like 60) doesn&#39;t like heights, dad climbed into the steel bucket and Johnny raised dad and the birdhouse up to the top of the pole. And it was hard driving four screws up from the plywood platform into the bottom of the house with his messed up arm. And, well, Johnny couldn&#39;t level the bucket worth a damn so his legs were all buckled funny and they&#39;re pretty sore too, what with dad forgetting to put his knee pads on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, with a dad like that, I feel a little awkward complaining about my sore shoulder from 30 minutes of woodchopping, or my sore knee from Sunday morning&#39;s yoga class. I&#39;m doing just fine, thank you. All day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, Dad. I love you. I hope I inherited some of your resilience genes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We Can Afford To Care For Each Other</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/we-can-afford-to-care-for-each-other/"/>
		<updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The provincial budget was announced yesterday and it&#39;s left me stunned and upset.  I can&#39;t remember feeling gloomier about life in Saskatchewan since the droughts of the mid &#39;80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I literally used STC on Tuesday to send a birthday package to my niece in Prince Albert and now it&#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, my grandmother died so poor dad&#39;s family got help with the funeral from social services. Now it seems that&#39;s gone too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, everything we have in Saskatchewan we got by working together and working for each other. Have we forgotten that? Or is that a myth? I still remember in-school dental care and mobile libraries. When we were much poorer as a province it seems we all had so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays our houses are bigger and our cars are shinier and our phones are magical, but public transport, public libraries and the like are things we aren&#39;t supposed to want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it selfish to want a service we all can use? Is it naive to want to contribute to services that help others, even if I don&#39;t use it? Should we only care about the poor, the young, the sick, the elderly or the remote when times are good? I don&#39;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even I caught myself looking at the announcements through the lens of &amp;quot;how am I impacted.&amp;quot;  Look, aside from the tuition hikes, which impact my kids severely, the provincial budget doesn&#39;t hurt me personally.  I&#39;m a middle aged, healthy white man who owns his house and no longer works for a crown corporation.  I&#39;m the &#39;core&#39; and I&#39;m not supposed to care about those who aren&#39;t like me, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do care.  And it pains me when those who most need our help have to pay so the rest of us can maintain the status quo.  That&#39;s not how this province was built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the lack of a long term, cooperative vision for all the people of Saskatchewan.  It&#39;s a classic dilemma: in boom times, we don&#39;t need a vision because hey, things are great as is!  And in bust times, we can&#39;t afford something as frivolous as cooperation.  We gotta take action and hey, poor people don&#39;t really need funerals anymore do they? In good times sure, but even the poor need to get realistic here, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s keep talking and working together. Talking about the kind of province we want to live in.  And working for each other, serving each other and building lasting institutions for all of us, even when times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to Meditate with a Golden Retriever</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-to-meditate-with-a-golden-retriever/"/>
		<updated>2016-07-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-to-meditate-with-a-golden-retriever/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to meditate for several years now. My thinking is getting more and more scattered, and my self talk more and more negative. So better relaxation and focus could really help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Resistance is large with this. It&#39;s as if it knows that better calm and focus will make its destructive job harder. So I thought about it but never started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I went for my regular long walk around Wascana Lake and listened to the audio of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Real-Happiness-Audiobook/B005402IGK&quot;&gt;Real Happiness&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; by Sharon Salzburg and for whatever reason it got me jazzed to try again. (The reason: it&#39;s a 4 week program so there&#39;s actual things to do. Oh do I need prompts!) So I&#39;ve made a 20 minute meditation session part of my routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing in the morning I get up, feed the animals, let them outside, then head downstairs for my meditation time. My back&#39;s too tight to sit cross legged for 20 minutes, so I lie on the floor instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just lie there and focus on my breathing. Start thinking about work? Go back to breathing. Relationships? Back to breathing. Past failures and future worries? Breathing. The fact that my back still hurts? Breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Buddy, our 10 year old golden retriever, barks to come inside. Breathe. Bark! Breathe. BARK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&#39;m coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back downstairs, and back to breathing. Now he&#39;s beside me. He wants me to pet him. Just breath. He inches closer, (breathe), closer, (breathe), closer, until he&#39;s leaning against my right arm and chest. Now I&#39;m breathing while petting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! He&#39;s gone now. Back to breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he&#39;s back with a toy. Plop. He drops it beside me. Breathe. Plop. He drops it closer. Breathe. Keep breathing and throw the toy. Bud&#39;s a golden retriever but he doesn&#39;t retrieve. He&#39;s got his own Muse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time he retrieves! Breathe. He&#39;s back with the toy. Breathe. He lies down with his toy. Ahh...breathe. Across my feet. Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ding! Time&#39;s up. Good session today, Bud. I&#39;m feeling relaxed, focused and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same time tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Resistance Won A Battle.  But I&#39;m Still Fighting The War.</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s reading about it, and then there&#39;s living it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Pressfield&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;  The book is a kick in the head for all creative people, including writers and entrepreneurs.   It both names and to helps fight the Resistance, that shitty part of your brain that stops you from doing the (seemingly) risky, scary and essential creative work you were meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve read all of Steven&#39;s non-fiction work and it helps.  But oh boy it&#39;s not helping this month.  The damn Resistance has me hard.  It&#39;s clawing at my brain stem right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may call it a migraine, but I know exactly what it is.  You don&#39;t just get a migraine when you sit down to write.  But I&#39;ve had three over the past week. Each time it takes me three days to get the courage up to write again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to trick it, by painting or recording a video instead of writing.  Smart, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it wasn&#39;t me that was being smart.  It was that f&#39;ing Resistance again, deflecting the whole time.  Don&#39;t create!  Research a new medium instead.  Look for tripods.  Adjust the lighting.  Watch yourself umm and ahh on video instead of writing clearly like you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a &#39;knock me in bed&#39; migraine today to finally get it.  I See You.  You prick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m writing about you now, Resistance.  Then I&#39;m hitting Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I&#39;m finishing my article.  And starting another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won for the last three weeks.  I won today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wascana.sk.ca/&quot;&gt;Wascana Park&lt;/a&gt; in Regina, Saskatchewan is often called the Jewel of the Queen City and that&#39;s true. It&#39;s a massive, lovely greenspace right in the middle of Regina, wrapping around Wascana Lake and anchored by the impressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Legislative_Building&quot;&gt;Saskatchewan Legislative Building&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s all man made, and we love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more often than not, the park is pretty much empty.  Cindy and I walk around the lake most days and we usually don&#39;t meet more than a couple of dozen people on our hour long walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major exception to this rule is Canada Day (July 1), when the park is full of people.  I walked down to the park in the late afternoon to check things out and see what was shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew things were hopping before I ever got to the park.  There were cars parked up and down Regina Avenue all the way back to Elphinstone Street and along the side streets too, as people came from all points of the city to have fun in the grass.  Lots of red and white outfits, miniature flags and interesting coolers full of refreshments too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; alt=&quot;Cool Cooler&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that&#39;s a cool cooler!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was lots going on.  I avoided the Legislature at the start and turn left instead, making a clockwise loop around the lake.  The area around &amp;quot;the Leg&amp;quot; (with a soft &#39;g&#39; please) was pretty loud.  I could hear a cover band playing the Canadian classic &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OX_8YvFxA&quot;&gt;Barracuda&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; so I gave it a miss for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I walked around to Willow Island and watched some kids feeding the geese.  The goslings are already getting pretty big and  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get even bigger after getting fed so much bread today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south side of Wascana Park has lots of barbeques and picnic tables and they were all in use today.  Heavily in use.  The barbeques are a perfect place for a family picnic and it seemed like each bbq had a dozen or more people using it.  There were ball games and badminton games going on all over the place.   Lots of fun. I was tempted to pose as a long lost cousin so I could get a hot dog and some watermelon, but I chickened out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Wascana Park is that it&#39;s so big, many thousands of people can come out and there&#39;s still lots of space.  For most of the loop around the lake is still green and lovely, even if the path is a little more crowded than usual on Canada Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;People Walking&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are a lot busier in front of the Legislative Building, however. There are lots of food trucks and knick knack booths and activities for the kids. It&#39;s a lot noisier than the rest of the park but there&#39;s a vibrant energy to the area too.  Lots of activities for the kids and grownups too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I left for home, I found where all the music was coming from.  This year, they had a real live stage set up with a fenced off beer garden.  Being Canada Day, I&#39;m sure the bands were playing Patriotic Songs of the Day, but I couldn&#39;t quite make out the words.  Ah well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be heading back to the park later tonight for the fireworks.  Canada Day fireworks are Regina&#39;s biggest, best (and some years, the only) fireworks of the year in the park.  They&#39;re not to be missed.  2017 is Canada&#39;s 150th birthday; I can&#39;t wait to see those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for a Canada Day walk through Wascana Park today, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-717-neil-young&quot;&gt;Marc Maron&#39;s interview with Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; in my ears.  If I was going to ignore the cover bands playing in the park, I figured I should at least listen to a Canadian interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were talking about love and art.  Neil said the key was to be fearless.  If you&#39;re fearless, you open yourself up to real love.  You can&#39;t make art, or make love work, if you&#39;re hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned 50 two days ago and this morning I caught myself, once again, worrying about everything.  Money, time, and the lack of both.  Fear of being rejected or worse yet, ignored.  Yet again, being afraid to write and to work and to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough!  I&#39;m 50 years old for crying out loud!  What, am I going to be afraid till I&#39;m 60?  70?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not now, then when?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent two interesting days exploring hot, sunny downtown Anaheim while Robyn was enjoying the air conditioned VidCon conference at the Anaehim Convention Centre. I&#39;d walk with her for the first two blocks, then she&#39;d head off, I&#39;d stop for my morning cappuccino and then head north to the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nice California ranch house in central Anaheim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Anaheim Resort District, aka Disneyland, a city of hotels, fifteen Denny&#39;s and a dozen IHOP&#39;s isn&#39;t actually the city of Anaheim. There&#39;s a real town centre that pre-dates Walt&#39;s Big Dream by 60 years or so, but it&#39;s separated from the Resort District by the massive I-5 Freeway. Harbour Drive crosses the I-5, and so did I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long hike in the hot sun. It took me 3/4 of Blonde on Blonde to make it (all but Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands) and honestly, it&#39;s just hot walking. I got to see the back side of Disney though, which is interesting in its own way. If I was ever making a James Bond film, I&#39;d film it there; all the unmarked white vans, security checkpoints, severe tire damage gates and electrical generators would make a great villains lair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once across the I-5, I thought I was coming up to a light security prison, or a half way house maybe. I saw a cluster of low, long army-green barracks with a tall wrought iron fence all around it. I was shocked to find it was a school! Each building was two or three classrooms with private entrances and a asphalt playground in the middle. Whoo boy would it be hot on that playground! I know security is a big thing in schools these days but man, they are taking it a little far at Orange Grove School if you ask me. Maybe it&#39;s colourful on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy had done some recon for me and told me about a downtown farmer&#39;s market on Thursday. So that was my first port of call. It was also my fourth port of call, since there was nothing going on at 10AM when I first arrived. I guess it&#39;s geared toward the office workers and doesn&#39;t really get going until noon. But it was worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market was laid out like a Y. The long bottom bit was the farmers; tables piled with melons and peaches and onions and strawberries. Lots of the fruit was spilled out cornucopia style, rather than the neatly stacked fruit at European markets, but it was all fresh and yummy and was all grown by the people selling it (which is rarely the case in Europe too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left arm of the Y was the artisans; jewelry, knick knacks and designer kibble for your pooch. and the right arm was the food trucks. Yum! Fried chicken, barbecue, falafel, wood fired pizza and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it was so hot that I couldn&#39;t really work up an appetite, or a big sausage on a bun would&#39;ve been my lunch. Instead, I bought a baguette from the bread booth and a basket of strawberries and ate them in the shade. It was the right call; I still had to walk back over the I-5 to get back to the motel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I hiked back downtown. After stopping at the public library to write a post and flip through a few books, I walked one block further than the farmer&#39;s market site to the Anaheim Packing House. This huge building was once the Sunkist citrus packing house, where oranges and lemons would get packed in crates and put on trains. Now it&#39;s a gourmet food centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 20+ food stalls inside, selling everything from sushi to ice cream. There&#39;s even a booth dedicated to variations of grilled cheese sandwiches. I walked around both floors twice before buying a barbecue chicken sandwich and a local beer, and then an ice cream cone for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not easy to get to downtown Anaheim without a car. But if you need a break from Disney and can&#39;t handle yet another trip to Denny&#39;s or IHOP, it&#39;s well worth checking out. It doesn&#39;t take me long to need a break from Fantasyland, so I&#39;m glad I went exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In Search of Sambo&#39;s</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been to Anaheim before, but it&#39;s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from weekend fishing and camping trips, I only took two family vacations with my parents. The first, when I was 10, was a three week trip to Windsor and Detroit (via Bemidji Minnesota and Niagara Falls) for my cousin Mary Catherine&#39;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was to Anaheim and Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came in March, when I was in Grade 7. I remember just how green everything was; from the moment we left the airport I couldn&#39;t believe all the green grass everywhere. Even the school fields were lush and green! We had prairie scrub at Ruth M. Buck school. Mixed with gravel. If you fell on the playground you were guaranteed a scraped knee and quite possibly some embedded stones. And anyway, it was St. Patrick&#39;s Day; my playground at home would be covered in snow for at least a month yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ahh, vacations... This way we have room for Granny!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There were five of us on the trip. My Aunty Donna, mom&#39;s youngest sister, was still single and flew down with us. She was the most important person in my 12 year old world; it hadn&#39;t been that long since she&#39;d been living in our basement on Bruce Street and then in her own apartment in Regina. We&#39;d watch the Carol Burnett Show together on TV every Thursday night and laugh like crazy. And she&#39;d let me read her old Mad Magazines and listen to her Donovan and Beatles records. She was so cool. But now she lived in Calgary, which would become the exotic escape for my sister Wanda and me for years to come. So we were thrilled she was coming on this big vacation with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna had a job working in PR at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, and she brought along a small bag of promotional material about Calgary. Since it was 1978, 10 years before the Winter Olympics would put Calgary on the world map, promotion was a big deal. But also, since it was 1978, it was still funny to roll up a fact sheet about Calgary, written in a tiny font on a small piece of paper, and put it in a clear plastic capsule. The fact sheet was titled &amp;quot;DOPE About Calgary&amp;quot; but all that showed on the capsule was the &amp;quot;DOPE&amp;quot; part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right, my hip, cool Aunt brought a baggie of white plastic capsules labelled DOPE on our family trip to California. You know what happened: she got picked for a random search at the airport, was asked about the baggie, and said &amp;quot;That&#39;s my dope!&amp;quot; Our time at the airport was a little longer than we planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did everything you&#39;d expect on a 70&#39;s romp through Southern California. We went to Disneyland, Knott&#39;s Berry Farm and Universal Studios. We took the bus tour to San Diego and Sea World, stopping at the mission at San Capistrano to see the swallows. We took a tour of Hollywood, saw the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre. It was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, Disneyland was a single park, ringed with tiny motor hotels and there was one big fancy hotel called the Disneyland Hotel. We stayed in a little motor inn, right across the street from the main Disneyland parking lot. The motel we stayed in wasn&#39;t all that different from the Alamo Inn that Robyn and I are staying in now, in fact. Although the this area has changed a lot in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our motel. Good beds, great air conditioner, horrid WIFI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now there are two Disney parks side by side; the original Disneyland and a park called Disney California Adventure. Between the two parks are at least four huge Disney hotels and a shopping street called Downtown Disney, where you can buy mouse ears and a shirt even if you can&#39;t afford a ticket inside (a whopping $160USD per person per day now!) And while there&#39;s still several classic motor inns around the park, there are also Hiltons and Marriots and Hamptons and all the other chains too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think California Adventure is where the old parking lot used to be. The parking lot for visitors is several blocks away now; there is a &amp;quot;Toy Story&amp;quot; bus line that constantly shuttles people to and from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they do a lot of shuttling! Disneyland is still a massive draw from what I can see. Every morning, the hotels around us empty my 8:30AM. Half the folks head east to the convention centre, wearing their red, purple or blue VidCon badges. But far more people head north one block to Disneyland, in groups of four or six or eight, typically pushing a stroller, often with grandma in tow, and always, always wearing mouse ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fashion is amazing, including the mouse ears. Disney sure has diversified since the 70&#39;s. No more black Mickey Mouse ears; now, everyone is bedazzled! Sequins, fur, sparkly bows, and even leopard prints are the rage. And every type of Disney t-shirt imaginable is being worn too. They even combine logos now. I saw Mickey as a New York Yankee, Mickey as a LA Dodger, a Laker and an Anaheim Duck. Oddly, not as a Saskatchewan Roughrider, but I&#39;m still looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the dads and grandpas is my favourite pastime. Dad&#39;s tend toward being sun-conscious or sports-conscious. That is, they either have the largest sun hat of the group (sensible and much needed if a little dorky) or are draped head to toe in the colours of their team. I saw all blue Dallas Cowboy fans, including hat, shirt, pants and socks and Cardinals fans who even had red shoes. It&#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my favourite beyond all others is the matching family vacation outfits. I saw a family of six wearing bright orange t-shirts with Snoopy silk screened on the front and &amp;quot;Marshall Family Vacation 2016&amp;quot; underneath. Brilliant! Others wore all pink or all yellow or all green. It reminded me of the stag and stagette crews all around Amsterdam, but these folks were off to Disneyland and good for them. Robyn&#39;s quite disappointed that we didn&#39;t get matching outfits when we did our trips to the Maritimes and Vancouver Island and maybe she has a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go Team Pink!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The other vivid memory of my first trip to Anaheim was the food. My dad is a very fussy eater and that intensified on vacation. On our first vacation to Ontario he insisted on only stopping at Husky House truck stops and ordered the same meal every time. This carried on to California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember walking twice a day, in the morning and evening, south from our motel, alongside the massive Disneyland parking lot, to the southern corner of the park. There, on the corner, was a small family restaurant with the unfortunate name of Sambo&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked to Sambo&#39;s every day for breakfast and every day for supper and Dad ordered the same thing every single time. Bacon, eggs over easy, white toast and coffee for breakfast and hamburger steak, soup and coffee for supper. When our waitress asked Dad if he wanted &#39;the usual&#39; on Day 3 he beamed. There was no way we were going anywhere else now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a few circuits around the Disney Resorts looking for Sambo&#39;s yesterday but I couldn&#39;t find it. I wanted to take Robyn and order a hamburger steak for old times sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure the name changed long ago but the building might still be there. My best guess is a place called Coco&#39;s which is right beside our motel. It&#39;s the right size and on the southwest corner of the current park, just like I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sambo&#39;s? Is that you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m wrong, then the building and a ton of other places have been torn down to make a new employee parking lot. It all depends on whether California Adventure extends further south than the 1978 version of the Disneyland parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noooo!!! Hopefully not, anyway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to pretend that Coco&#39;s the old Sambo&#39;s and will be sure to go there. Gotta keep the old memories alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m keeping my mouth shut at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/off-to-anaheim-california-this-is-travelwear-finding-calm-and-something-to-eat-in-a-sea-of-people-buddy-can-you-spare-a-screen/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The travel bug is incurable. Once it&#39;s in you, any daily routine that doesn&#39;t involve leaving the house early and exploring new surroundings just doesn&#39;t cut it. So after 3 weeks of trying to find something new in the city of my birth, I jumped at the chance to cash in some air miles and head for the airport again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite daughter Robyn is heading off to VidCon, the annual YouTube conference in Anaheim, California. Her friend and travel companion couldn&#39;t afford the trip this year but Robyn was determined to go. She&#39;s not really comfortable travelling alone however, so I&#39;m going as a roommate and Chief Transportation Officer. My main role as CTO is convincing her to walk around Anaheim even though it&#39;s 30C+ every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I booked my flight two days before leaving, I couldn&#39;t get the same flight as Robyn. Not the same airline either. Or even the same connecting city. So while Robyn flew to Los Angeles via Calgary, I took the longer route and headed east to Minneapolis. I had the opportunity to go to the airport at 4AM to catch my flight too. Take my word for it, Regina sure is lovely and peaceful at 4AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&#39;t get over the difference in how people dress in North America vs. Europe. My frumpy shirt and baggy pants make me the well dressed one here! The plane to Minneapolis was full of ball caps, t-shirts (not always covering bellies) and shorts. There was one guy in his 50&#39;s wearing pale khaki short shorts with a black Motley Crüe t-shirt stretched over his belly. At 4AM! But at least he has a black leather bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got caught up listening to 4 younger folks talking before we boarded. Two are off to Detroit to watch 3 baseball games in 2 1/2 days. Another man (in a suit, by the way) was off to Calgary, while a woman was going to her second house in Phoenix. She was 45 at most. She and her husband sold the house and now they were putting the furniture in storage while they looked for a different house. Flip and grow, I guess. I seem to have chosen a different path. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t deal with either fashion / lifestyle extreme, to be honest. The race for stuff and houses to put them in, or the general &amp;quot;I Work On The Rigs&amp;quot; look. I know I&#39;m being an anti prairie-ist, but there were very few people on the plane with whom I felt comfortable striking up a conversation. Maybe I was just tired and missing my partner in travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing my travel companion. A seat was available too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Spain, everyone dressed like an architect or an industrial designer. They couldn&#39;t all be architects, but still. I&#39;d much rather talk to someone who is well dressed than hope against hope that the Gold&#39;s gym gorilla boarding behind me sits down before my row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is though, I really love travelling. I even love airports, so long as I have a lot of time. I love wandering around the shopping area, buying an incredibly expensive coffee, and people watching. And you&#39;re not going to find a more diverse and eclectic group of people than at a major hub airport in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harried mothers with a bevy of young babes in tow, all eating a messy chocolate donut and then rolling on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of every nationality with fashion proportional to the distance from Minneapolis (the further away, the nicer the clothes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young sales types, looking dashing and serious and trying to exude success, walking with their middle aged mentors, who still have the dress but have softened significantly around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And everyone, I mean everyone, either sleeping, &amp;quot;doing business&amp;quot; on the phone or gazing, deep and unblinking, into the blue glow of their smartphones. If, heaven forbid, one is too poor or too forgetful to bring a phone, all the seats at the gate have tablets for some last minute deep gazing before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a three hour layover in Minneapolis, but when I booked my flights Cindy noticed that the connection home is very tight. I&#39;ll have 30 minutes to get from the LA plane to my plane home to Regina and Minneapolis is very large indeed. So I checked arrivals and departures board to get the lay of the land. If the gates are consistent (and these are daily flights so I bet they are) it&#39;s going to be a challenge to make my connection. We&#39;re talking two opposing wings of the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having time to kill, I did a dry run and timed myself from gate to gate. Through a combination of one flight of stairs, moving sidewalks, a tram and speed walking, I made it gate to gate in just over 9 minutes. So if I can get off the plane in 10 minutes, then run like hell with an empty bladder, I should make it before they close the gate with a minute to spare. To be safe, I tried to upgrade my return ticket to sit near the front, but it&#39;s not allowed on my Air Miles redemption. I shall have to try over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

I blame my overly polite Canadian-ness for a mistake I made on the second leg of my flight. The flight was full, and the overhead bins were going to be over stuffed, so the gate attendants asked for people to volunteer to check their bags. Since I had two hours to kill at LAX waiting for Robyn&#39;s flight to arrive, I volunteered.
&lt;p&gt;The problem came when I went to collect my bag before finding a place for lunch. Once I arrived at the baggage carousel I realized that I had passed out of the secure area. The secure area was also the area with all the restaurants. A slice of Banana Bread from Starbucks was my lunch and early supper until I hiked across the airport to find Robyn&#39;s terminal, she landed, we found a shuttle bus and made our way to our hotel in Anaheim. I made it, but will be packing an apple with me for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just in case I was feeling too cozy as the new Hemingway of the travel scene, ready to run with the bulls or get into the ring to wrestle Mickey Mouse, the young lady at the Starbucks called me sweetie. I don&#39;t think my hunky action hero appearance is working here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I should be getting used to it by now; it seems like there&#39;s at least one mass shooting in the US every month. You just process one and then there&#39;s another. But the shooting on the weekend in Orlando struck closer to home than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids are young adults; they go to night clubs all the time. And my daughter is part of the LGBT community. I woke up Sunday morning and realized they&#39;re a potential target for someone&#39;s ignorant, pathetic hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s got a trip planned to LA next week. I&#39;m scared to have her go. Even though there&#39;s seemingly a lot of people there who are armed to the hilt for &#39;protection&#39;, it doesn&#39;t give me comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, the crazy nonsense I&#39;ve been reading online over the past few days has me worried that there&#39;s no &#39;normal&#39; any more down south. Hell, I&#39;m sticking to stamp collecting forums and I still see more hate, ignorance and paranoid fear than I can stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are just floating through space, you know? Just trying to make sense of this crazy messed up thing called &amp;quot;life.&amp;quot; And when I read some of the reactions to the latest disaster I realize I&#39;m no closer to figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse: the sick hatred that&#39;s behind these crimes or the fear and ignorance that fuels the flames. All I know is that the story is getting really old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t remember a time in my life when we weren&#39;t encouraged to hate another group, be it national, religious, racial or sexual. Can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I walked down to the Farmer&#39;s Market today. It was fun to see the vendors again and catch up on things. It&#39;s been two years since I baked for the Market but lots of people still want to see our bread there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was lots of interest in our trip and what we saw. There was even more interest in what we were doing next. Sadly, I think my response was a poor one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this habit of telling people I need to figure something out, because I can&#39;t be &amp;quot;unemployed&amp;quot; for much longer. But that&#39;s the wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m already talking to several places in town about starting or improving their bread production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are people signed up to The Baker&#39;s Bench who are ready for another baking course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m running into people on the street who say they enjoy our travel blog and want me to keep writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether I say it or not, I&#39;m already a baker, a teacher and a writer. And I&#39;m doing all those things. I just didn&#39;t get paid today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s too easy to describe ourselves only in terms of what we do for money. That&#39;s a trap. There&#39;s a lot more going on in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What&#39;s Your Medium?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-s-your-medium/"/>
		<updated>2016-06-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-s-your-medium/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently watched &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2104994/&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; on Netflix (also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZAJY23xio&quot;&gt;YouTube here&lt;/a&gt;.) It&#39;s a complete interview from 1995 when Jobs was running Next, before he came back to Apple, launched the iPod and iPhone and basically ruled the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview was a real trip down memory lane for me because I remember the PBS show &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Nerds&quot;&gt;Triumph of the Nerds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (on which they showed excerpts of the interview) very well.  I loved that show; I may still have the much watched VHS tape I made of the series and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_Empires&quot;&gt;the book on which it was based&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the basement. Although the host didn&#39;t know it, the show was about me, my life in high school, University and my first career as a programmer at SaskTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was really taken aback listening to him now, some 20 years and a lifetime later.  Steve Jobs&#39; ideals and vision resonate with me now even more than they did in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best bit for me had nothing to do with technology.  At the very end of the interview, Jobs was asked if he was a Hippie or a Nerd.  After declaring for the Hippies, he defined what that meant to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Hippies see that] There&#39;s something beyond what you see every day. There&#39;s something going on here in life that&#39;s more than what you see.  More than a job and a career and a family and two cars in the garage...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...It&#39;s the same thing that causes people to be poets instead of bankers.  I think that&#39;s a wonderful thing.  And I think that same spirit can be put into products.  And when you give that [the product] to people they can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...So, I don&#39;t think the best people who I&#39;ve worked with, worked with computers for the sake of working with computers.  They worked with computers because &lt;strong&gt;they are the medium that is best capable for transmitting some feeling that you have and you want to share with other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a weird feeling hearing that now because I started out using computers with exactly that feeling.  Lately I use flour and water and bread as the medium.  But the goal is the same: to build something awesome and share that spirit with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I no longer have my bakery, I need to find something else to do. But I&#39;m after more than just a job; I need a different way to share that spirit.  It might be with bread, or with words, or even with technology again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve tried explaining this to prospective employers or partners but I&#39;ve been scraping around the edges.  That segment in the video helped me find the centre again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s your medium?  What glimmer of awesomeness are you sharing with other people?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Way Back Is Shorter</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-way-back-is-shorter/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People do it all the time. I know that. And yet our 8 hour flight to Europe was one of the longest and most difficult journeys I&#39;ve ever taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard on the mind and body to fly all night, trying to sleep while sitting upright, then finally landing in a bustling major airport in a foreign country. You&#39;re tired, sluggish and disoriented. The signs don&#39;t make a lot of sense. Everyone&#39;s in a rush, but it&#39;s unclear what they are rushing toward, or away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re here! Figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Lisbon, it took us at least 20 minutes to figure out how to buy a train ticket to our apartment. How hard can it be? Money can only go in so many slots, after all. But the first decision in a new country takes on a ridiculously huge importance. I&#39;ll easily blow five euros on the wrong drink on Day 10, but spending a euro too much on the first train is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness for adrenaline. The physical fatigue of a sleepless night is more than balanced by the excitement of a new adventure. On the way out, pure adrenaline goes a long way to getting you where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first few days, we&#39;re settled in to a new routine. Get up, eat, walk around. Every few days, move on. It&#39;s a wonderful, invigorating, sustainable groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as soon as our route faces home again, a switch flips in my brain. Living in the present is no longer enough. Thoughts of home and the future flood in and time speeds up. When we returned to Amsterdam for our final leg of our trip, I felt like I was killing time until our plane left in four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how, but this had me thinking of home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And time just kept speeding up. That same eight hour flight home felt like a drive to Saskatoon, except with two meals. Just like that, we&#39;re home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this new accelerated pace is all in my head. I&#39;m jacked up, I can&#39;t sleep, but all around me is slow. The grass grew, but not that much. That pile of laundry is still sitting in the hamper. There&#39;s nobody out on the street. It&#39;s hot like an August scorcher, but the peonies haven&#39;t even bloomed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shoeson.madbaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-way-back-is-shorter/images/image-1024x1024.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s taken a week to get over the time travel and match the pace of the world around me. To get a good night&#39;s sleep; to not just bolt up at sunrise and pace about. To hang out in the afternoon like the dog and the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the evening, to plan out the next trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://carolynmark.com/&quot;&gt;Carolyn Mark&lt;/a&gt; for inspiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.spotify.com/track/4lVKUyBhu8vyq5tQfmQkg4&quot;&gt;the title&lt;/a&gt;. I sing her songs often and with gusto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I learned another thing about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smugmug.com/&quot;&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt; privacy settings works.  It&#39;s a very good service even when I mess up the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

I still dream about living here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We arrived home safe and sound on Monday night and aside from stronger than expected jet lag (I&#39;m still getting up at 5AM then collapsing in bed by 9pm,) things are good. We&#39;re heading out for walks every day, Cindy&#39;s putting our house back together and I&#39;m either lining up meetings and visits with people or generally worrying. Back to normal all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing has been happening consistently that is taking a while to get used to again. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who we pass on the street says &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;good morning&amp;quot; to us. Every single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I was walking alone down Argyle Road at 7:30AM, when the only other person on the street passed me with a hearty &amp;quot;Good Morning!&amp;quot; I was shaken awake and found my manners in reply at the last possible moment before I could be classed as rude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve slowly had my manners worked out of me in Europe. Even when we were cycling in Holland and would pass another cyclist, they wouldn&#39;t even make eye contact. Not even if we were the first person they passed in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in March, our host in Evora, Portugal told us about a trip she took to Calgary. She asked if it was our &amp;quot;costume&amp;quot; in Canada to say hello to strangers on the street, because that&#39;s what everyone did to her in Calgary. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot this week about Maria as I get used to our customs again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also had several people replace &amp;quot;Good Morning&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Welcome Back&amp;quot; which has been very disconcerting. I mean, when I recognize the person it&#39;s one thing, but this morning two men passed us in the park and said &amp;quot;Welcome Back&amp;quot; and I had no idea who they were. But one fellow said he was following this blog so knew we were home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continued the walk, I muttered something about how I was surprised that people I don&#39;t know well were reading this blog. At which point Cindy hit me and said I just needed to stop worrying and keep writing. She does that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog for one person. Our friend Deborah asked if I&#39;d be writing about the trip and I thought it would be fun to send dispatches home. But I never imagined so many people would be following along. Thanks for reading and commenting and emailing and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks, Deborah. We&#39;ll come visit soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep writing, here, there and everywhere. I&#39;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. I just realized Cindy filmed that crazy hand-crank Dutch bike ferry &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/holland/&quot;&gt;I told you about&lt;/a&gt;. Here it is...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Tale of Two Bridges</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/4ZZr2C4iiH-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Funky drawbridge over canal, Rotterdam&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funky drawbridge, Rotterdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/holland/&quot;&gt;cycling trip through Holland&lt;/a&gt; I was repeatedly struck by the beauty of what we would call the &#39;infrastructure&#39; of the place. The street signs, the light posts, but especially the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country with as many canals as roads, you&#39;re going to have a lot of bridges. I was surprised to see that many of them had unique and beautiful designs. They were functional works of art. And many of them had the builder or designer prominently displayed right on the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine the effort that went into designing these bridges. The design competition and the decision process to install this bridge here, and this different design three blocks over.  It would&#39;ve added to the cost, but added something remarkable into the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_VZpG2RWgN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_VZpG2RWgN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Nameplate on a drawbridge, on the main road somewhere between Utrecht and Amsterdam&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nameplate on a drawbridge, on the main road somewhere between Utrecht and Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a new footbridge near my home in Saskatchewan too. It connects the high school with a park and, beyond, a small library on the way to the city centre. The old bridge, no more than 60 years old but, alas, made of wood, must have been deemed unsafe in this modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no art to my new bridge. It&#39;s exactly the same as the other new footbridges that cross Wascana Creek. It&#39;s made from galvanized steel (same as the recent grey/silver light posts) and pressure treated lumber. It may not be beautiful but it&#39;s likely the cheapest way to cross the creek on foot. There&#39;s no name on the bridge, or any of the other bridges crossing the creek, identifying the designer or the builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt the decision to build the bridge in my town was based solely on cost. What design can give me the most bridges for the least money? Can we use existing &#39;off the shelf&#39; components? Which installation crew is the cheapest? Then ask those questions in a blind bidding process and pick the cheapest option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&#39;t create anything lasting, or beautiful. It won&#39;t make my heart sing every time I walk to the library. The galvanized steel handrail won&#39;t feel good when I hold it. But hey, at least the builder was chosen through an objective and fair process. And Our Tax Dollars were used &#39;responsibly.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that sad.  And a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a hundred opportunities every year to add art and beauty and good design to the world we live in. To choose the beautiful and interesting as well as the functional. To move people with our public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to add beauty to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Holland:  Rime of the Ancient Cyclists</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/holland-rime-of-the-ancient-cyclists/"/>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.&amp;quot; - &lt;em&gt;Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&lt;/em&gt; Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holland is the land of the bicycle. I read it from home, read it again on the plane from Venice, but learned it first hand at David&#39;s Burgers in Leiden, Netherlands on Saturday night. As we waited for our burgers to get grilled up, I sat and watched the cyclists negotiate the T intersection; left to the train station, right to the University, and right then left over the bridge across one of the many canals that striped the city centre. I watched groups of young boys, young women in pairs and alone, old couples, families with two kids in the front. I even saw several riders hauling a friend sitting side saddle on the back rack. One girl straddled the front rack, facing the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leiden, Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My favourite was a young couple who were clearly on a date. Both were impeccably dressed, although the boy (who was driving) had a large pack on his back that his date needed to avoid, since she was sitting on the back rack, holding her purse on her lap and eating a banana with her free hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike parking is hilarious. There are way, way more bikes already parked than there are people in the town. There are racks everywhere. Many are double decker racks too. Rows and rows of them, throughout the town. And at any point in time they are 80% - 90% full, so people just park their bikes in the general vicinity of the racks. Most Dutch bikes have a quick and easy wheel lock that renders the bike useless when locked, so you don&#39;t have to actually lock the bike to anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/OdhcF71tyo-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/OdhcF71tyo-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all these bikes around us, picturesque towns all close together, and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of smooth paved bike paths around us (over 7000km in the Netherlands as a whole), you&#39;d think it would be easy to rent a bike, right? Not for us, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IbIjlMvNDg-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/IbIjlMvNDg-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leiden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We were looking for bikes and saddlebags to carry our clothes while we rode from town to town. But while bikes are available at every train station, they don&#39;t rent bags. And the places that might have bags to rent or buy were closed for their May long weekend. Argh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/vgpimqWsVs-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/vgpimqWsVs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did find one place in Leiden that could fit the bill. Budget Bikes (now there&#39;s a warning for you) was open on holiday Monday and had bikes and bags. At least I think they had bikes to rent. It said so on the window. But when we went inside the nice but shockingly dim young men had a really hard time coming up with two bikes to rent. They pulled one out of the back garage, and finally went through their stock of questionable used bikes for the second bikes. The bikes were old and clunky but the chains weren&#39;t too rusty so we gave them a go. But they were way too small, no matter how high we raised the seats. After a couple of hours of riding my knees and back were screaming at me as, hunched and dejected, I finally found the bike shop again and gave back the bikes. No way could we ride these for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we explored Leiden on foot. It&#39;s an extremely picturesque little university town, 30km or so southwest of Amsterdam. Brown row houses lining cute little canals. Lots of good looking young people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/qrursxd55v-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the shocking aspects of Holland is how expensive everything is, from food to clothes to accommodations. Especially accommodations. In Leiden, we stayed at a minor hotel so far out of town that it was right on the border of the next town and it was still our most expensive stay so far (it would seem cheap in a week.) It was a good long hike into the city centre, but there was an intercity bus that ran straight past the hotel, along the highway to The Hague, so we caught that if the weather threatened rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, we found that things in the Netherlands cost 1.5x to 2x what things cost in Italy, which was already 1.5x the prices in Portugal. Bus and train fare was double. Meals? Double. That 6 euro breakfast for two in Lisbon was 15 euros in Leiden. Lunch ran 20 - 30 euros. And supper? We tried to avoid restaurant suppers when we could, or did our &#39;two appetizers and a shared main&#39; thing to manage our cash. We were here two weeks and had to make our funds last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodations were a challenge throughout. Not just the cost (which was routinely 50% - 100% more than anywhere else bar Paris), but availability. The Netherlands in general, and Holland in particular, is booked. The days of carefree Mediterranean travel, where we booked a room the night before arriving, and paid half or less than our benchmark (the Park Town Hotel in Saskatoon) were over. Now we paid like the Park Town and stayed in the Super 8. But there were a few lucky exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to these bikes. After the long weekend had passed, we took the bus to The Hague, figuring that the larger city would have a place that rented bikes and bags. But after a day of walking from bike shop to bike shop and finding only one shop that rented bags as well (a hippy run coffee shop whose owner insisted he had &#39;great bikes&#39; in the basement), we decided to loop back to Amsterdam and go to the first bike shop I&#39;d emailed from Italy. They had bikes, bags, and would store our suitcases while we toured. So the next morning we took the train to Amsterdam, got the bikes, and took them on the train back to Leiden. Then we rode the bikes back to The Hague, experiencing the Netherlands bike route junction network for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the coolest thing. As I mentioned, there are over 7000km of paved bike lanes all over the Netherlands. The larger paths are part of the junction network, a spider web of paths that connect every town and village in the country. Armed with a map of South Holland, we could trace a path anywhere we wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how they work. Every major bike path intersection is given a number. There&#39;s a sign at the intersection with the number, plus arrows giving directions to the next junctions. For example, if I&#39;m at junction 70, the sign will say go left to get to #68, right to #53, and keep going straight to #71. So all I have to do to get from Leiden to The Hague, for example, is write down all the junction numbers I need to pass through, in order, then connect the dots as I ride along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not perfect; some of the sign are vague, like when a single arrow points in between my two options at a fork in the road. Or when a low post is buried in extra long grass. Or when road construction, usually around a busy train station when we&#39;re leaving a city, forces a detour around your junction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blink and you miss it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But we found an app for Cindy&#39;s phone which had the paths marked, if not the junction numbers. So when we left the path we could at least figure out which way to ride to get back on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first ride, from Leiden back to our apartment in The Hague, we retraced the bus route we took the day before for a while, before heading west to the coast. The Hague is very close to the Atlantic Ocean, so we cycled past gorgeous farms, then private villas and mansions, before hitting sand dunes and the coast. Rain was coming quick so we didn&#39;t linger, and we certainly didn&#39;t swim, but it was great to see the ocean, the long sandy beach, and the huge barges off on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hague is a beautiful city, one of our favourites on the whole trip. It&#39;s the seat of government in the Netherlands, (although Amsterdam is the capital; quite different from home) so you&#39;ve got fine government buildings and lots of attractive, prosperous people on the streets. And there&#39;s also a lot of very stunning, unique modern architecture, from the massive, all white City Hall and public library to the funky, new De Resident neighbourhood right beside the historic main square. De Resident is extra cool; they got a different architect to design each apartment building, so each building is unique. But each building also ties into it&#39;s surroundings as well. They act as a bridge between the old city to the west and the modern skyscrapers to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/C-FgM7KtG0-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/C-FgM7KtG0-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were extremely lucky to find a cheap studio apartment right in the De Resident neighbourhood. We had a great modern flat, with these stunning buildings on one side and the old town on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/GrWh1Pa3Zd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would&#39;ve easily stayed two more days there but, alas, it was booked. So we spent another half day walking about after our ride from Leiden and headed out the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From The Hague, we rode south and east to Delft. It was a great ride, but cold. Although the clouds threatened all day, we stayed dry for the most part, riding on smooth, straight roads, along beautiful canals and past tidy little farms. Of course, we realized too late we were on the wrong side of one particularly long canal, so rode a few kilometres extra before finding a bridge and doubling back to our hotel. It was a modern place, The Shanghai Hotel Holland no less, but it was an easy ride to Delft town centre once we dropped off our saddlebags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delft is small and charming. It&#39;s known for its blue glazed pottery, which guarantees some tourists, but it&#39;s also a university town, so there&#39;s lots of energy to the place. We spent a delightful afternoon and morning wandering up and down the streets, crossing every bridge and sitting down at as many cafes as we could handle. We found a great mom &amp;amp; pop bakery for coffee and pastries, and also found the square where all the students went for evening coffee. Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we were about to leave Delft, we stumbled across one of the best experiences of the trip. We were crossing the main square, between the large church at one end and the hall at the other, when a newly married couple left the church and cycled over to the hall, followed by the wedding party and all the guests. All were dressed up, carrying blue and white balloons, and all were riding bikes. The lovely bride was in a cart in front of the lead bike, pedalled by the groom. In the background, the church carillon played wedding melodies while the bride and groom did two loops of the square then led the entire procession into the hall. It was elegant, teary-eye romantic and very, very Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Delft we rode on to Rotterdam, one of the largest modern port cities in the world. But you wouldn&#39;t know it from the ride; we spent a cloudy and rainy morning cycling through &lt;em&gt;polders&lt;/em&gt;, the low fields that are completely surrounded by canals and are actually lower than the larger canals that run along side. Most of the polders had two or three cows, or some sheep and lambs, or maybe a few goats, all lazily grazing on the lush green grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canals were a blast. I&#39;ve never seen so much wildlife so close before. We cycled past families of ducks who had nests in the middle of the water, or wedged into the bank. We saw huge white swans, many geese and even several great blue herons, just doing their thing in the water. They weren&#39;t scared of us at all. Heck, I got scared when we&#39;d ride past some tall grass and an unseen duck quacked right by my foot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotterdam is another of our very favourite cities. The combination of waterfront and crazy modern architecture is exceptional. It reminds me of a quiet version of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out hotel in Rotterdam was right downtown, on the canal, on a converted barge no less. We were right near all the action and breakfast was included. Excellent! We locked up the bikes and spent the next few days wandering around this beautiful city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was just up the road at the Markthal, Dutch for Market Hall. Holy Cow, what a place! Cindy read that at one point the Dutch were concerned that the European Union would outlaw open air markets (as if!) so in typical Dutch fashion they fixed things by building a massive, 10 story tall dome and put the market inside. The ends of the dome are just clear glass, but the sides are 10 floors of apartments and restaurants, that curve around the dome. I still can&#39;t get over this structure; I can&#39;t even decide if it looks better from the outside or the inside! But the food inside is amazing and the restaurants are very good too. There&#39;s even a Jamie Oliver Italian restaurant there that seems very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Markthal has permanent stalls inside, there&#39;s still a massive twice weekly outdoor market on the square beside. So as it was now Saturday we checked that out too. Lots of fruit, meat, fish and cheese, along with all the household items and clothes that fill out these markets. I chickened out though and passed by the haring (herring) stand, although I watched a few locals eat the cured fish, smothered in raw onions, in two big bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the square from the Markthal is the Rotterdam Public Library, one of the best libraries I&#39;ve ever been in. Even better than Bologna. Not only are there a ton of books and other media, but there&#39;s a pretty good coffee shop too. It&#39;s full of cookbooks so you can read while enjoying a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know that I&#39;m a big fan of libraries. 10+ years after stopping the planned shrinkage of the Regina library system, I&#39;m worried we&#39;ve stagnated a bit at home. I was encouraged by some of the cool modern libraries I saw in European cities big and small, but especially in Rotterdam. It&#39;s in a great location, is in an amazing building, and has a ton of places to sit and work. And you know what? It&#39;s busy! We could barely find a seat to read and write in the six floors we checked out. I guess if you make a comfortable space to read and work, people will use it. Time to get busy at home...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one day on our stay in Rotterdam, we left the city via the water-bus and travelled just outside of town to Kinderdijk. It was time to figure out windmills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the modern architecture in Rotterdam is because they had to rebuild the city after bombing in World War 2. But the bombs missed Kinderdijk and there are still rows of windmills dating from the 1740&#39;s there. We walked along the polders and went inside two windmills to learn more about how they worked and what it was like to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windmill operator lived in the mill permanently, with his family. In one windmill, the operator lived with his wife and thirteen children! It was a tough life and things changed only recently. Windmill operators lived in the windmills up to the 1950&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s how they work. Remember how I mentioned that the polders are lower than the surrounding land? Well, the windmills help keep the polders from filling back up with water. A row of windmills sits on a narrow strip of land between the polder canals and a higher canal. When the wind blows, the windmill turns a big wheel that literally scoops the water from the lower polder canal and throws it up into the higher canal. Then, another set of windmills throw the water from the higher canal up even higher, into the Lek River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right, all the land is lower than the level of the river! It&#39;s fascinating engineering, but it really brings home how the Dutch have literally built their country. Most of Holland would be a large inland sea if it weren&#39;t for all this moving water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday morning was rainy, but we had booked rooms up the road, so we bundled up and set out for our next destination, Gouda. Land of cheese, but with many more names than just &#39;Gouda.&#39; The ride was hard; even though there&#39;s a finite amount of &#39;wet&#39; one can get, it&#39;s pretty cold riding. But after around an hour and a half of riding, the rain stopped and we slowly dried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the day&#39;s ride was just outside of Gouda, when we rode past a community garden. But this was much more than a collection of garden plots. Each plot had a large shed/small cottage that was clearly made for the gardener. A place to hang out as he tended his crops. Many of the plots looked more like small yards than a mere vegetable patch. We wandered around and checked things out and took pictures of the sheds. Hopefully I can build one at home and turn it into a writing studio. With a day bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gouda was yet another picture perfect little town with a shop lined centre, lots of canals and in this case, a very ornate old town hall right in the middle of the square. While it looked pretty large to me, the hall is too small for a town as important as Gouda, I guess, so they built a new town hall just outside the centre. Surprisingly, it&#39;s designed to remind one of a stroopwaffel. Not cheese. That&#39;s because the cinema, right next door, already looks like cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the cheesy time we had, we did actually find a very, very good cheese shop in Gouda. We got some lessons on how to pick a good cheese, ate far too many samples, then picked up a few wedges for our packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Gouda, we headed north and west to another University town, Utrecht. It was a fun ride - no rain - but the clouds were threatening all day and we were buffeted by a strong crosswind. The land wasn&#39;t a lowland polder fest, instead it was much more park-like, and it was as green and as full of wildlife as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just kept tracking our junction points, stopping for a snack now and then, and in a few hours we were at our new apartment. But not until we negotiated some major construction work, right around the train station, of course, and at rush hour. In Holland, rush hour means a lot of cars but even more bikes, so it was a very, very crowded bike lane for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utrecht was a really fun town. We rented a traditional Dutch home, a very comfortable, narrow row house with steep, twisty stairs and a small back garden. It belongs to Solveig, a very nice young woman who is studying at the University. We had a great visit when we arrived and learned a bit about the Dutch post-secondary school system. There are three types of Universities depending on the type of courses, which explains how everywhere we went was a &#39;University Town.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architectural highlight about Utrecht, aside from the excellent library (why are all Dutch libraries so awesome?) is the Dom Tower. It&#39;s the highest bell tower in the Netherlands, even though it&#39;s no longer attached to a church! It used to be connected to a very large cathedral, but a large storm in the 1600&#39;s destroyed half the church, right in the middle. The Protestants, who ran the church at the time, figured it was a Sign that the church was too gaudy, so left the centre in ruins. Now the centre has been cleaned up and is the delightful Dom Square, an open square between the tower and the remaining church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give guided tours of Dom Tower and we took one. It&#39;s very good. The tower is so big that we stopped on three levels to learn about what was going on. Not just up then down like in Siena. The first two levels are private chapels, and the top two levels contain all the bells. Both 14 large bells, of which seven still remain from 1502, and a 40+ bell carillon that can played like a very large organ. The carillon can be played by a musician, but is also connected to a large wheel that plays a melody every 15 minutes. The melodies can be programmed much like a paper reel on a player piano, but with large metal pins and the tune changes over the year. We were told that the new carillon player in town is young and modern and will even play rock tunes on the bells when she has a concert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this leg of the trip was cycling, so we didn&#39;t linger for too long in any one city. But we did get a full day and night in Utrecht, which meant we walked back to the centre that night for a &#39;Utrecht by night&#39; walking tour. Students have set up light displays throughout the centre that run after sunset (around 9:45pm in May) and there&#39;s a walking route to see them all. Some lights are on buildings, some in the trees and others are under bridges along the canals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the light displays aren&#39;t too spectacular, the walking loop is a lot of fun. Tiny illuminated arrows are placed in the cobblestone sidewalks every so often, marking the route. They are far enough apart that you really have to look for them, and on quiet, nearly deserted streets in a Medieval town centre, it can get a little spooky. And there was a big payoff at the final point of the tour: the Dom Tower was lit spectacularly, right at the very top of the 95 metre tower. Right at the top of the hour, the lights went out, then the carillon played for a long time as the lights came back on and swirled and danced over the face of the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our final ride of our Holland loop, from Utrecht back to the bike shop in Amsterdam, we finally got some sunshine. Eight days of cloud and intermittent showers, plus one day of just plain rain, was making the bike rides a bit of work. But this day the sun was out and the sky was blue (well, blue-ish) as we set off on the bike path. Our route took us away from the highway and even away from farms; today we were in cottage country. We rode along large lakes filled with small yachts and lined by very fine cottages. Some were all out villas. Ahoy, rich folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our best ride of the trip, even though it was the longest. Only 30km by car, the windy bike path is much longer, but much more beautiful, so it took us five hours to get to Amsterdam. But it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the canals seemed completely dedicated to cyclists. At one point, there was a manual &#39;bikes only&#39; ferry to get us across the canal! We loaded our bikes on, then turned a crank again and again to pull the ferry across the canal. What fun! At another crossing we once again needed a ferry, but we were now crossing the Amstel river so there was a proper boat and driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there we were. Amsterdam. One second we were riding down a country lane, then we crossed a bridge, turned a corner and saw a stack of glass skyscrapers. We made it. By this point we blended in fairly well with the locals, screaming down our bike lane, turning corners without flinching, and cursing out tourists who kept walking in &#39;our&#39; lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final three blocks to the bike shop, deep in the heart of Damstraat and tourist central, was a little hairy, but we made it, returned the bikes, reclaimed our suitcases, blended in with the hoards and found a tram to our final AirBnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has a tourist problem, and they know it. The &#39;Old Town&#39; area between the Central train station and Damstraat is completely, utterly clogged with tourists and weed smoking hippies. It&#39;s not a lot of fun down there; maybe 25 years ago, but not today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had a great display at the library (another winner - what is it with Dutch libraries?!) about the tourist problem in the Old Town. They see how tourism is only growing and they have to choose between being like Venice (the city as museum and nobody can live there anymore) or New York (lots of tourists but people live and work in Manhattan too.) And they have the building plans to change things too. It was cool to see such forward thinking about their city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zxhD5HtrNF-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/zxhD5HtrNF-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as crowded as it is, get outside this 5-10 block area and the city opens up amazingly. Literally, just go from this block where you can&#39;t even see the buildings for people, walk across the bridge and go one block and it&#39;s peace, quiet and locals. So that&#39;s what we did. Even when we had to go &#39;across town&#39;, we steered around the centre instead of going through, and had a delightful three days in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/cPcAqaXWgy-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/cPcAqaXWgy-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It still took a while to warm up to Amsterdam though. Too many thoughts about heading home, too many realizations that this would be my last good coffee, or Cindy&#39;s last poffertje (tiny pancake treat) to enjoy what was in front of us. Plus I got a nasty flu bug on our first day and was too dizzy to ride the tram into the city; it took a day to get fit enough to walk around. But finally, on Sunday, our last full day in Europe, we figured Amsterdam out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/MErtVicAAD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/MErtVicAAD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started in Vondelpark, a large, pedestrian/cyclist only park in the middle of the city. Seeing so many people out enjoying the day shook the gloom off my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the good vibes continued as we walked along lovely tree-lined streets, with a canal in the middle and tight, narrow, crooked row houses running the length of the block. We stopped in bakeries, took a good look at what everyone was eating for brunch, and window shopped for shoes and a new suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we turned the corner and fell in love. We had reached the Museum Quarter, with a gorgeous concert hall at one end, the massive Riksmuseum at the other, and the ultra-modern Van Gogh Museum in the middle. Beside the Van Gogh museum was a huge green space, and behind that, an exceptionally cool open air antique market. And within the market, was the coolest trio of street food vendors ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poffertjes, made fresh and served hot. No syrup, just butter and powdered sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FKSYzM71MA-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/FKSYzM71MA-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Fries, fried twice and served in a cone as the Good Lord intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a French stall serving grilled sausage, on a slice of toasted rye bread, with one swish of mustard. Simple and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, served with a glass of wine too, because we&#39;re in Europe and it&#39;s a civilized place. Not only will the world not end if you have a glass of wine in the park on a Sunday afternoon, but maybe your Sunday afternoon will be just a little better. A little more awesome. A little more perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was for us. So perfect that we enjoyed every bite, savoured every sip, and felt a connection with every soul who was sitting in the park with us on a cool, grey, gorgeous day in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we cried a few happy tears, went back to our apartment and started packing. Tomorrow we go home.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Veneto: Great Food and New Friends</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m from where food is grown. Maybe not all the food I want to eat (I love a good orange), but still. Meat, grains, vegetables. We feed people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s a special place in my heart to visit places where the food is grown. And in Italy, it&#39;s grown everywhere. But nowhere more than in the Veneto. Our friend and baker Giacomo was from the Veneto and told us so many stories of his homeland that we just had to go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Bologna, which is actually a little south of the Veneto, in Emilia-Romangna. It&#39;s known as the food capital of Italy, genesis of the entire &amp;quot;Slow Food&amp;quot; movement. It&#39;s the home of tortellini, mortadella (aka &amp;quot;baloney&amp;quot; at home), tagliatelle and, of course, bolognese sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all true, but I&#39;ll remember Bologna as the City of the Portico. Most all the buildings in the old city centre have porticos on all sides; arched coverings that extend over the terrazzo sidewalks. If it&#39;s raining, and country this green must get a lot of it, you can walk all through the centre without getting wet. One portico is over 3km long. Legend has it that it was built to transport a statue of the Virgin Mary between the church and the square; after years of it always raining on festival day, the town fathers built the world&#39;s longest portico for a permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our apartment in Bologna was one of the best of the trip. A cozy rooftop flat tucked into the top corner of a large block, requiring us to pass through three iron gates and cross two passages with open views of the centre courtyard to get to our door. But inside we had a modern kitchen, a low ceiling sitting room, the most comfortable bed of the trip, and window that opened to the sky above. Even with all the sights in Bologna, I needed two afternoon naps in that cool, breezy bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporary bakery set up in the square beside our flat. Baking traditional cookies and bread as a fundraiser. I found it by smell!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flat was right beside the main food district, the Quadrilatero, so we walked down there straight away. The narrow four block area has been the food hub of Bologna since Roman times and it&#39;s still going strong. It&#39;s filled with fancy shops selling perfect fruits and vegetables, fresh pasta, cheese, oil, meat and fish. We saw our first butcher specializing in horse meat (a delicacy in northern Italy) although we didn&#39;t have the guts to try any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food here is the most expensive we had seen in Italy, but it was so fresh, and presented so well, that we didn&#39;t have any objections to loading up our shopping bags and cooking this great food in our apartment for two meals. There are also many excellent restaurants in the area, but when the food in the shops is that good, I just have to cook. Bags of fresh tomatoes, garlic and zucchini, plus lovingly wrapped parcels of fresh pasta and wedges of the best parmigiano made their way up to our room. We feasted that week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s awesome just how many of what you think of as &#39;Italian Food&#39; came from around Bologna. Aside from pizza, almost all of it. The city of Parma, home of parmigiano reggiano cheese and Parma ham, is just down the road. Modena, where all the best balsamic vinegar comes from is right there too. What a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is beautiful too. We explored it in depth thanks to Robyn&#39;s &amp;quot;Walking in Italy&amp;quot; book. Setting aside the miles of porticos for a moment, Bologna also has a huge, interesting main square, anchored with a massive statue of Neptune in the middle (even though the city is far inland.) It also has two huge towers in the city centre, so tall, so narrow and with such drastic leans to them that I was too scared to climb them. Although Cindy braved the climb and took some great pictures to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main square also has the best public library of the trip so far. It sits inside the Sala Borsa, the former seat of the civic government, and you can see even older ruins through glass floors on the main level. It&#39;s popular with readers and a major tourist attraction as well. Come on, Regina, get going with the public buildings already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day, we left the centre of town for a walk in two local parks. Two, because we started off in the wrong direction and found an open &#39;wilderness&#39; park high on a hill outside the old town. It was nice, but a little too remote for our lazy day plans. So we headed back into town and found the &#39;city&#39; park very close to our apartment, but in the opposite direction from where we started the trip. That was OK though, because the detour took us past our new favourite lunch Cafe. We dined on sandwiches, wine, with fresh strawberries and ice cream for dessert, all from a high patio beside the street. It was a perfect venue to hang out and watch the world drift by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Bologna after stopping at our new favourite gelato shop for breakfast. Hey, when you make unique flavours, in house, from organic ingredients, and get recognition from the &#39;slow food&#39; folks, and when you&#39;re right across the street from our apartment, you are a perfect gelato shop for breakfast! Gelato then a walk to the train station - talk about leaving you wanting more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Verona on a whim. Our friend Giacomo, who is from the Veneto, sent us a message that said &amp;quot;Verona is nice.&amp;quot; That was enough for us! And you know what? It is nice. Very, very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train ride was very short but intriguing, because the landscape looked a lot like home. We sped through flat, green farmland, just like at home if we still had trains. Sure, many of the farms had grape vines and orchards, but there was wheat too and attractive vegetable gardens. And mountains! The start of the Alps, with Gran Paradiso and the Italian Lakes off in hazy blue distance. They&#39;d have to wait, but on a clear day they set off Verona&#39;s buildings beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know Verona as the setting for Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet. There&#39;s a bit of recognition here; a balcony with a sign &amp;quot;just like Juliet&#39;s&amp;quot; etc. but not too much. What Verona had for us is the Holy Trinity of Awesome European Cities: rivers with lots of bridges; a castle; and a Roman Arena. We spent two wonderful days strolling along the river and trying to figure out the best view of the castle, and touring the local cathedrals. When that got tiring, we&#39;d sit in the town square, sip Spritz (the local specialty) and gaze at the Arena that was smack dab in the middle of the square. It&#39;s in good enough shape that the Arena is still used for operas in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to gloss over the beauty of Verona. It&#39;s awesome. But by this point we were settled into a gentle Italian groove that was so relaxing and so satisfying that I could keep it going forever. Our toughest decisions were selecting the right gelato shop from fifty options, or whether to dine at a small family run pizza shop or the neighbourhood Osteria (we did both!) We found a lovely square near our apartment, and away from the tourist loop, which had enough bars and restaurants to keep us occupied for a week. So long as you knew the Italian words for &#39;horse&#39; and &#39;donkey&#39; in order to navigate the menu, it was smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was bliss. I was in a beautiful country, with amazing scenery and delicious food that was reasonably priced, with friendly people and just enough chaos to keep things interesting. I was with the woman I love. The sun was shining and the river was blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we didn&#39;t think things could get any better. But it did. It got better because we got to meet Giacomo&#39;s mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giacomo grew up in Padua, east of Verona, but his mom Alessandra recently moved to Malcesine, west of Verona, along Lake Garda in the famous Italian Lake District. So on Saturday we packed up and took a train, then a bus to Malcesine to meet her and her partner Angelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcesine is beautiful. The whole lake is, really. It&#39;s a resort lake, for sure. A deep blue lake, surrounded by tall mountains and full of sailboats, windsurfers and very few powerboats. The single highway along the lake was crowded with cars and hundreds of cyclists. Everyone was out in the sun and having fun. The lake is very popular with Germans; most of the signs were in Italian and German and the owner of our hotel spoke better German than English. We even saw some German bakeries in the town. But there was enough pasta and gelato available to confirm we were still in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alessandra is a delightful lady, who misses her son very much. Cindy and I were her connection to her boy so we have many hugs to give him when we get home. And she fed us enough that I&#39;m sure some of the food was for Giacomo too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely day together, wandering through the old town, strolling along the lake, eating gelato and comparing Italy to Canada. Alessandra&#39;s English was better than our Italian and we had Google Translate to bridge any gaps. Angelo didn&#39;t speak any English at all, but he spoke sports, so he and I talked football and cycling. We even watched the end of the day&#39;s Giro d&#39;Italia stage on TV together and cheered whenever anyone named Giacomo was mentioned. And I learned that I must cheer for Juventus and never Milan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could only spend one day together, sadly, because Alessandra had to work and we had to get back to Verona for my special splurge of the trip. I saw a poster that the Hellas Verona football club was playing their final home game of the season on Sunday night, against Serie A champions Juventus no less! Since Juventus had already clinched the title, and Verona was guaranteed to be relegated at season&#39;s end, there were still tickets available, and we got two very nice seats in the neutral side of the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was awesome. I&#39;ve never heard so much noise and singing at a sporting event before. The away fans from Torino were extremely loud, singing praise on their Juventus or abuse at the Verona fans. And then the Verona Ultras would reply and the stadium would shake with their booming songs. Thankfully I don&#39;t know enough Italian to understand the words. I assume it was mild, like &amp;quot;Our Team Is A-OK&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bad Luck, Visitors&amp;quot; and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started off rocky for us until we realized that, even though Verona was the home team, there were many, many people in our section who were there to see the champions Juventus. Lots of families with young boys wearing the black and white stripes of their heroes on the visiting team. So we made sure to cheer everyone and not look too happy when the home team spanked the champs 2-1 to end their season on a high. Verona striker Luca Toni, playing his last game as a pro, took a lap of honour after the game and I cheered along; his was the only name I recognized from the home team, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Verona for the second, and final, time on Monday morning, we headed east to Padua. We&#39;d been in the Veneto for a long time now but we still wanted to see some of Giacomo and Martina&#39;s home town. Plus, Padua is just outside Venice, so was a nice stepping stone to the famous lagoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Padua is a beautiful city and well worth a visit on its own. It&#39;s got some amazing architecture, not least is the huge market building that is surrounded by three distinct squares. The building itself is full of market stalls; butchers, bakers, fishmongers, cheesemongers and wine shops and the surrounding squares are full of fruit, vegetables and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about these market squares is the variety of what&#39;s on offer. It goes well beyond food. So many of the market stalls, up to half in some cases, are for non-food items. Soap, dishes, small appliances. Clothes too. Racks of shirts. Stacks of denim, or socks, or underwear. Mannequins displaying lingerie even. I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t do it. I&#39;d try horse meat before I&#39;d buy underwear from a market stall. Or even a new outfit. I&#39;m not ready for that yet. But lots of people are, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also blessed with one of the very best gelaterias in Italy (better than Bologna? OK, a tie) right beside our Padua apartment. We couldn&#39;t go there for breakfast, because &amp;quot;La Romana&amp;quot; didn&#39;t open till noon. But we went for several nightcaps, along with 50 or 60 other Padovans, just before the midnight closing time. Even after we met Francesco and Nicolo for a late goodbye beer, we still had time for one last gelato at La Romana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tour d&#39;Giacomo included a bus ride out to the suburbs to visit Pasticceria Paride, the bakery Giacomo worked at before he left Italy. It&#39;s a lovely little place, right in among the residential neighbourhood, with coffee and gelato and croissants and delicious little sweets. After a few attempts with our bad Italian, they figured out why we were so interested in the place, and Paride invited us into the back to watch them work for twenty minutes or so. One of the bakers spoke English so we had a great time comparing equipment, techniques and bakers hours. Paride wanted to know what type of things we made at Orange Boot. He doesn&#39;t make bread, and I think he likes the fancy pastries better, but we got along. Especially after I grinned and complemented him on his chocolate tempering machines. I can&#39;t see how Orange Boot version 3 can exist without them. And gelato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also connected up with Francesco and Nicolo, two friends of Giacomo&#39;s who all lived together in London before Giacomo came to Canada and they returned to Padua. They took us all around the city, taught us the right way to order Spritz and tramezzini (tiny sandwiches) at the bar, and then took us out into the country for an amazing authentic Veneto meal. We talked for hours about life in Italy and they asked a ton of questions about life in Canada. They want to come visit soon. I sure hope they do, so we can show them around Regina like they treated us in Padua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Padua, we went to the Scrovegni Chapel to view the famous frescos by the master Giotti. The entire chapel is covered in a cycle of paintings telling the same bible stories about Jesus and Mary that I learned in Sunday School. Except in this case, the paintings were done in 1305! It was stunning. The paintings were in remarkably good condition; I was surprised to learn that any deteriorating has happened in just the last 100 years, as structures surrounding the chapel were torn down. Now water can damage the paintings from the outside in. But I think some of the exorbitant viewing fee is used to pay for restoration work. I hope so; it&#39;s an amazing space of art and history, and well worth preserving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we went to Venice. One of three tear-inducing, I-can&#39;t-believe we&#39;re-actually-here places on our trip, along with Paris and Odeceixe, Portugal. After all the beautiful places we&#39;ve seen in Italy, I really wasn&#39;t expecting much of a thrill from Venice, but oh boy was I thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it starts before you even get there. The city really is an island, just like they tell you. OK, a series of islands, but they are way out there. The train line crosses more water than you expect before you get to the station. And you can&#39;t really see the city from the train. You cross along the causeway, leave the train, wade through the station along with a thousand other people, then pop out onto the plaza with the Grand Canal, water taxis, those lovely stacked buildings and a Cathedral just right there, staring at you. It&#39;s breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venice is so tight, so narrow and twisty, and full of canals and bridges and interesting little shops, that it&#39;s almost a requirement to get lost. We spent four hours wandering around the city, based loosely on the route in Robyn&#39;s book. We tried to follow the map but got lost repeatedly, weaving off and on the route the entire way. It was a cool and rainy day, but we went with the flow and always seemed to duck into a bar or restaurant just as the sky opened up. Let it rain - we have Spritz and pizza!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here&#39;s a tip. Even if you&#39;re travelling light, like us, consider checking your bags at the train station, rather than lugging them through town. We only stayed one night in the city, so we put a change of clothes in our backpacks and left the rest at the station overnight. It was much easier finding our hotel without lugging bags up and down the bridge steps and dodging fellow tourists. Watch even one newlywed couple try to get back to the trains, with a chivalrous husband lugging two huge suitcases through the alleys of Venice and you&#39;ll forego luggage all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Venice is packed with tourists (and it is &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt;, let me tell you) the vast, vast majority of people head straight to Plaza San Marco and stay there. We went, we walked, and we admired it, but then we left the square and wandered to the edges. It was pretty much empty out there but no less interesting. There are just as many shops, and amazing contemporary art, and excellent coffee, and food too. And you can walk a bit in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead end!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then in the evening, after the busses have gone back to Mestre for the night, we went back to the square and really took it all in. It&#39;s wild. Really, the best formal square of the trip, and we&#39;ve seen a few. It&#39;s just really weighty, heavy and perfectly proportioned, from the clock tower that is huge and solid, to the St. Mark&#39;s Basilica, that is big and gorgeous and shiny and gold in the evening light, to the three rows of buildings and continuous porticos that make up the square, but run at odd angles, so the square really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s heavy enough to be very, very impressive. It&#39;s so heavy, in fact, and so close to the Grand Canal, that you really do get the impression that Venice is sinking. I mean, you pile that much stone on a spot and it&#39;s bound to sink a little, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our last night in Venice, our last night in Italy in fact, we took it slow. A nice meal of chicken and vegetables and pasta, sharing a table with two delightful Dutch ladies. A gondola ride that went right past our hotel. A stroll along the Grand Canal and past the opera house. Then off to sleep in our romantic old 6 room hotel deep in the Venetian maze. Tomorrow will be a new country and a new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip is nearly over and the thought of coming home, of no longer travelling, of not having markets and terraces and good coffee and gelato and local fruit has me in a melancholy funk. My mood is the same grey-blue that is all over Venice at dusk. Dusk is the time that you feel the age of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice feels old. Really old, and tired. More tired than anywhere we&#39;ve been. It&#39;s carried the weight of its citizens for hundreds of years, and now carries the weight of the hoards of tourists. One news agent had a sign saying &amp;quot;Venice Is Not A Theme Park&amp;quot; but honestly, with so many tourists coming through every day, even in this &#39;shoulder season&#39;, it kind of is. There isn&#39;t a single business on street level that isn&#39;t focused on the tourist trade, and I was looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s the thing about Italy. The place really pulls at you. We came here as tourists and we&#39;re leaving as tourists too, I guess. But it&#39;s just so damn comfortable. Sure there&#39; street history and architecture, I wasn&#39;t here long before I started acting like I lived here. Where&#39;s the hardware store? Where can I buy a toaster? Where&#39;s the bike repair shop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d live and work here in a minute, if I could. Give me a coffee bar, a fruit stand, a gelateria and an Internet connection and I wouldn&#39;t leave my block. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Buongiorno. Il mio nome è Marco. Sì, l&#39;Italia è bella . Vieni a sederti. Hanno po &#39;di vino!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tramping Through Tuscany</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the hot cliffs and beaches and clear blue skies of the Cinque Terre, we headed inland toward Tuscany. Our first stop was Lucca, a hot tip from our bakery friend Elanna. It&#39;s well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ride to Lucca was short but full of interest. We passed through Cararra, home of the marble made famous (to us) by Sarah Richardson and all her decorating shows. An episode isn&#39;t complete until Sarah picks out a slab of Cararra for a countertop or backsplash. Well, it all comes from a single mountain outside this town. We passed the white marble mountain, then through the town with work yards full of marble. Huge blocks that could be used on the Pyramids and row after row of thin slabs, ready for a kitchen or bathroom in Harbour Landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we turned inland, through tall green hills with villages wedged in between the slopes and gardens and fields in the valleys. The land was green, fertile and full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucca itself is unique in that it has an intact city wall, surrounded by a green space and even a moat (ok, a canal) in places. The wall was designed by Leonardo da Vinci, no less, and has never been breached. From the train station outside the walls you need to find a gate through the walls to get into the old town. But the best part is the top of the walls is a long, wide, wonderful walking / running path and park. You can walk around the entire town on top of the wall, and many, many people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the wall is an old medieval village with black slate, twisting cobblestone streets. The only change seems to be the replacement of blacksmiths with gelaterias. A stone lined canal runs through one corner of the town and feeds several public fountains. Locals line up to fill collections of glass water bottles directly from the fountains, even though the tap water is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots and lots of bikes in Lucca. In fact, I bet the number of cyclists outnumber the cars. Our first afternoon in town we had lunch at a tiny cafeteria and watched bike after bike pull up and park at a church next door. After the 30th young woman or man rode up and parked we figured there was something going on. Something stylish because all the cyclists were very well dressed; more for a concert than a workout. Finally we realized that they were all picking up kids from the school beside the church. One by one the parents or grandparents came out of the school with a child in tow. Some kids walked beside mom&#39;s bike, some rode on a rack in the front or the back (or both!). Some came over to the cafeteria for coffee and a cookie. It was the closest thing to when the daycare let out beside our bakery, but with bikes and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still cars, and with all the cars, all the bikes and the complete lack of sidewalks, walking around could get treacherous. Especially near the squares with fountains and odd traffic circles. These spaces gave the best views but also had the biggest risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a cool old bakery in the middle of town that was pretty jammed full of people, but I wedged my way in and bought some bread and focaccia. The baker spoke English so we talked a bit about how it was nice to try &#39;real&#39; focaccia, especially as I made a version at the bakery at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing was that his focaccia was quite a bit different than the &#39;real&#39; focaccia I had in La Spezia, only 30km up the road! The La Spezia version is a little thicker and quite a bit more oily. My new friend in Lucca said his was the Real focaccia, and I preferred it. But I made a note not to beat myself up so much when people tell me I don&#39;t make a &#39;real&#39; German Rye or a &#39;real&#39; Sourdough loaf. There&#39;s as many versions as there are bakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered all around Lucca, through the town and up on the walls. Cindy&#39;s book of walking tours gave us some nice routes so we didn&#39;t miss a square or a church. We even paid to walk up a tower in the middle of town to see the whole town and surrounding countryside. It was beautiful. Brown-red buildings surrounded by green trees and rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had so much fun in Lucca that we decided to stay an extra day, in order to see their Saturday market, even though our apartment was spoken for. So we booked a room in a pension for one night and moved 300 metres to new digs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big mistake. That particular Saturday was a washout. As in, massive Noah style rains. The walk to our room was only three blocks but we were completely drenched. Rather than go to the market (which was cancelled anyway) we hung all our clothes to dry and, after a delicious pizza lunch, stuffed newspapers in our shoes and hoped they&#39;d dry in our cold, damp room. Cindy&#39;s shoes were dry enough to head out for a much needed haircut, and learned that her new favourite stylist has a cousin in Regina. No kidding! We have someone new to call when we get home now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damp but undefeated, we left Lucca on Sunday morning on the train for Pisa. Even without the Leaning Tower, Pisa is an interesting city. It was an ancient maritime powerhouse that collected many riches via trading and menaced the surrounding towns. Many of the castles we visited in the area were fortified to protect the citizenry from attacks from Pisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked our bags at the train station and strolled around Pisa, once again following a route from Robyn&#39;s excellent &amp;quot;Walks in Italy&amp;quot; book. We walked up to the main square the Campo de Miracoli, and saw the famous Leaning Tower and the Cathedral beside it. All the white marble buildings in the square shone against the bright green grass of the square. It was cloudy outside, but I could imagine how the buildings would stand out against a bright blue sky too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon got freaked out by the crowds of people in the square, though. It was jammed with people all doing the same thing - posing for pictures. Either selfies with those infernal sticks or three thousand people doing the exact same &amp;quot;hold up the tower&amp;quot; pose. This often required the camera person to sit on the ground, across the sidewalk from the poser, to get the angle just right. And boy did they get mad when you walked in front of them! At least the first 500 people did. Then I walked behind the posers to photobomb as many selfie shooters as I could before Cindy got mad at me and we left the square. Well, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of Pisa outside of Campo dei Miracoli was pretty much deserted, so we had a delightful afternoon following the route in Robyn&#39;s book. We walked up the Arno River, then crossed the bridge and walked down it. We went through Girabali square for gelato. And we found a delightful little park surrounded by restaurants for lunch. We actually went in one block to a tiny pizza restaurant where we were the only English speakers in the place. Only long tables of locals out for Sunday lunch, chowing down on pizza or these immense focaccia sandwiches, that were as big around as a pizza but three times as thick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full and footsore, we walked back to Pisa Centrale station, collected our bags, and hopped on our train to Florence. We had booked an AirBnb apartment just outside of the city centre, right near the tram station. We met our host Frederica, got the keys and settled in for the next four nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Florence, I realized I didn&#39;t really know what I wanted to see there. I had always wanted to see the Duomo, that large red dome that towers over the rest of the city, but beside that, I didn&#39;t have a lot of ideas. Thankfully, Robyn&#39;s book came to the rescue. We spent two delightful days trekking through the streets, alleys and parks of central Florence, walking along and across the Arno River (upstream from Pisa), sitting in the delightful little squares, having gelato at Vivoli (as seen on &amp;quot;I&#39;ll Have What Phil&#39;s Having&amp;quot;) and walking through the large central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Florence provided many &amp;quot;bests&amp;quot; of the trip so far. Best espresso macchiato, from the Grand Cafe beside the Plaza San Marco. Best leather jacket hard sell, from the vendor in &#39;leather alley&#39; (I looked fabulous, but 300 euros was way outside my budget.) Best hard sell leather bag (150 euros, still too much) from the same block of stalls. And the best loaf of bread on the trip, bar none, from Pank, upstairs at the central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upstairs of the market is very interesting. It&#39;s been turned into an upstairs food court, but from what I could tell, they are all connected. Sort of a big food family. I know I poo-pooed a similar setup in my Lisbon post, but at least this was a complement to a real market, not a replacement. And it had a real, proper bakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a ciabatta loaf which looked nothing like any ciabatta I&#39;d ever seen. It was baked really dark and looked more like a flat loaf of bread rather than a flatbread, if you follow me. The bakery was open for viewing so Cindy and I sat for an hour on high stools in front of the oven and watched the baker do his thing, baking off deck after deck of long pizza breads that were baked with tomato sauce, then topped by the sandwich prep baker and baked again before serving. Everything from the bread, to the baker, to the counter staff was awesome. They were all pros, 100%. We ate an excellent apricot tart and watched everyone work like a well oiled machine, like Orange Boot on our best days, then told them how great they were and headed out. Later on, when we ate the ciabatta on a church bench, we wished we&#39;d bought more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Florence we caught a bus to Fiesole, a hill town just outside of the city. It had amazing views of the entire city as well as the valley around Florence, but the highlight of the day was the extensive Estruscan and Roman ruins. We walked for an hour around the excavated baths and temples before having lunch sitting in the Roman theatre, which is in good enough shape that they still hold concerts there in the summer. Then we walked through a really excellent museum where they displayed Estruscan, Roman and Longobard (ie, Lombards, the Germanic folks who came after the Romans) artifacts that have been found at the site and around Fiesole. This included several Longobard tombs which were exhumed and moved to the museum intact. A little creepy but extremely interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Florence we moved on to San Gimignano, a small medieval hill town in the heart of Tuscany, where I am writing this now. It took a little doing to get here - a train to Poggibonsi, 11km away, then a somewhat harrowing bus ride up the hill to the gates of the old town. But from the moment we got off the bus we&#39;ve been in love. It&#39;s simply stunning here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really got those Scotiabank RRSP ads where 50-somethings exclaim &amp;quot;we can afford that villa in Tuscany!&amp;quot; but now I do. This is serious upper-middle class adult Disneyland here, except it&#39;s real. High, rolling hills all around you that are impossibly green. Vineyards off in every direction, growing Chianti grapes or the lovely Vernaccia white wine grapes. Rows of tall, thin cyprus trees lining the country lanes. Olive orchards where there aren&#39;t grapes. Red brick villas dotting the countryside. An beautiful wild poppies in the every ditch and around every fence post. Holy cow it&#39;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent two sunny days exploring the hills around San Gimignano. We&#39;d leave after breakfast and descend down from the town, through vineyards and past impressive villas, stopping only to admire the views, take a few more pictures, and wonder if some of the old stone shacks were for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day was a winding 14km hike to the neighbouring town of Certaldo. We followed a meandering route along a ridge line through the hamlet of Pasole before finally descending down to Certaldo. It was a gorgeous walk till we hit the town; the final kilometre or so was along a busy highway. Then we rode a very cool funicular up to the old townsite for gelato and more exquisite views. Then we hopped the train to Poggibonsi and the bus back to San Gimignano, before heading off for our best meal of the trip. We had a lovely traditional Tuscan meal of charcuterie, pasta, Vernaccia wine and dessert on a patio overlooking the valley we walked through earlier in the day. It was a big splurge for us, but oh so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second walk, on May Day, was intended to take on a loop past the hill town of Ulignano. It started off brilliantly, descending down through a forest of poplars and pine trees, past acres of vineyards and the winery itself. But then the route branched off to a dirt trail that was described as &#39;treacherous when wet.&#39; And it sure was. The road was all mud from a big overnight rain, and the soil was heavy clay like back home, the kind that would suck off your rubber boot on the school playground. We tried our best but abandoned the trail before we hit the bottom of the valley; better that than to lose our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

This pic&#39;s for you, Ed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we tried to follow the highway to Ulignano and retake our trail on high ground, but it was too much. Too much traffic on the narrow highway was No Fun, so we retraced our steps through the forest and climbed back up to San Gimignano. I think we walked twice through the best part of the hike anyway, so it was all good. We even saw two tours of horseback riders and two crazy mountain bikers, who were descending the hill we were climbing as fast as they could. It must&#39;ve been fun, because one biker rode back up the long, steep, gravel road and screamed past us a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, in between our two hikes, we hopped on the bus and took a day trip to Siena. Yet another gorgeous Roman town with high walls, a huge cathedrals and narrow, winding streets. We don&#39;t seem to be getting tired of that yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D9yOS0wCe--1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/D9yOS0wCe--400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siena was a really big deal in the 12th and 13th century, and the architecture shows that. They were competing with Florence to see who could have the best art and the most ornate cathedrals. (San Gimignano, by comparison, took the more literal approach and tried to build the most and tallest towers.) Siena did a pretty good job, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the best structure for me was the soccer stadium just outside the old town and right beside the bus station. It was lovingly nestled in a bowl in a little valley, surrounded by trees and a few bleachers. Siena plays in the lower leagues in Italy but they have a top tier stadium in my books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were planning on eating in for our last night in San Gimignano but at the last minute I made a reservation at another traditional Tuscan restaurant on a quiet side street, away from the tour groups. We had a final amazing meal in Tuscany, more meats, more pasta, and a roast rabbit with a sauce containing chocolate and wine. Delicious! A perfect end to a perfect stay in Tuscany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, Cindy&#39;s mom said she was worried that we&#39;d find a place that was so beautiful that we would just pull up stakes and move there. Well you could do worse than Tuscany, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;d need to make new money to get there, but it sure is a worthy goal. The views, the climate, the food and the wine are simply wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the crazy thing? Today we&#39;re taking a train to Bologna. Not in Tuscany, but by all reports it&#39;s the &#39;food capital&#39; of Italy. How can it be better than this?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>La Spezia:  Gateway to Cinque Terre and So Much More</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sitting outside, in glorious sunshine, on a 50 metre long iron bench at the La Spezia Centrale station on the Ligurian coast. La Spezia is known as the Gulf of Poets, because back in the gloomy 18th century English poets like Byron, Shelley and Dickenson traveled south to get away from rainy England and swim a bit. I can see why they came. It wasn&#39;t raining much in Paris, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll ever feel the need to &amp;quot;get away&amp;quot; from Paris, but still. It sure wasn&#39;t warm and sunny and blue like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t come straight here. Instead, from Paris we went south to Nice on the French Riviera. Beautiful city and you really should go if you have the chance. But since Nice is the big city near Cannes, St. Tropez, Cap Ferrat and Monaco, it&#39;s a little glitzy and glamourous. Which is all good, but a little awkward when you&#39;ve been wearing the same clothes for six weeks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Nice has going for it is fabulous architecture, a narrow and twisty old town, a cool tram system that cuts silently through town, two amazing outdoor markets and outstanding gelato (go to Fennochio&#39;s in the old town.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days chilling out in Nice, walking to a market to get strawberries, oranges, fresh peas, a baguette and some cheese for lunch before wandering around the city for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long we&#39;d be down at the beach, wandering along the miles long promenade, checking out the people roasting themselves on the beach and trying to stay calm among men in tiny speedos and women sunbathing topless. Sure, the tiniest speedos were worn by old hairy grandpas, and the topless sunbathers were grannies for the most part, but we were in France, on the Riviera! Just go with it, man. Time to get over the years of body image conditioning we grow up with in North America and live like a local! Well I would&#39;ve stripped right down to my gitch for the cultural exchange, you know, if it weren&#39;t that I sunburn easily. So I took off my socks and rolled up my pant legs to just below the knee, and strolled along the water for a bit, averting my eyes all the while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s a marketing lesson for you all. For all the glamour you&#39;ve seen, read, or heard about the marvellous French Riviera, has it ever come up that the long, glorious beaches are all rocks? Well they are. Miles and miles of what we&#39;d call river rock back at home. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was uncomfortably sitting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here, of course, is to Accentuate The Positive. Decades of starlets and royalty sunning themselves along the Promenade des Anglais has glossed over the complete lack of sand. And hey, even now, a few days later, I&#39;ve forgotten it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/q67547Se1S-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last evening in Nice we decided to hike up one of the hills surrounding the bay for a better view of things. But I misread the map and instead of a 2km loop I went to a further hill, 3.5km away and much taller. We walked forever, up and up. At one point we counted a run of 285 steps when the road got too steep for cars. But the views from the top, both of the teenagers making out and the surrounding hills, coast, villas and yachts, were worth it. And we already had a wood fired pizza restaurant at the bottom of the hill picked out for dinner. Pizza, salad and a half litre of the local grape and we&#39;d forgotten all about the climb up. All that was left was the amazing view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SJzXG46rm2-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/SJzXG46rm2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2NrCRjWJ-P-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, on to Italy. Our train to La Spezia required two changes, and we were late for both of them. But Italian trains are more relaxed on Sunday, it seems, so the trains were both waiting for us. One of my minor stresses with AirBnb apartments is keeping our host waiting for the check-in, so I was glad to get there close to our planned time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And a big highlight was sitting amongst some very, very posh folks on the train between Nice and Monte Carlo. The fellow across from me was either a Swiss banker or Benedict Cumberbatch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first impression of Italy is one of relaxed joy. First off, it&#39;s beautiful here. La Spezia is nestled in the centre of a U shaped bay, with small mountains all around. The dark green of the trees behind, the bright, azure blue of the water in front, with colourful pink, yellow and cream buildings in the middle. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/w5lwzBBCAU-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/w5lwzBBCAU-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the food is everything we&#39;d imagined. Simple, fresh and cheap. In France, the food is excellent, but you pay a big premium for those perfect French peas or local strawberries that are placed oh so perfectly in the baskets. Here, the markets are still full to overflowing with tomatoes, peas, strawberries and the cutest baby zucchini, but you just grab a bag and dig in. And the price is at least 30% cheaper than just around the bay in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a modern apartment on the other side of the train station from downtown. It was lovely, because we got a tiny chance to live like a local. The block around our apartment had everything we needed, really. A two person, hole in the wall, wood fired pizza place that sold so much of the local specialty, farinata (a thin omelette made of chickpea flour,) that they could hardly fit pizzas in the oven. A gelato shop that sold trays of ice cream to take home. A butcher/deli, a bakery/coffee shop, a specialty food shop, a fruit stand, a florist, a pharmacy and a Coop. We could pull together a picnic lunch, go adventuring, and come back for pizza for supper. It took us two days before we thought to look for a central market; they have one, and it&#39;s glorious too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Spezia is the gateway to the five villages of the Cinque Terre, made famous in North America by Rick Steves and his travel shows. There&#39;s stress on these former fishing villages due the crush of tourism, but that&#39;s how we heard of the Cinque Terre so I&#39;m not going to over think this. It&#39;s beautiful, we&#39;re in the area, and we&#39;ll try to tread lightly. So we hopped a train to the third village of Corniglia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back before modern tourism hit the Cinque Terre, the villages were quite isolated. They were only accessible from the sea or via a narrow and winding trail that connected all five villages. And the villages are close enough to each other that a hiker can walk to all five villages in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what we wanted to do, but the first two trails between Riamaggiore -- Manarola and Manarola -- Corniglia were closed due to mudslides. But that still left us half the trails to walk. Once we got up to Corniglia, that is. From the train station at sea level there was a huge set of steps up to the village. Forgoing the shuttle bus, we walked the 310 steps to the village. It&#39;s getting easier and easier to climb like this, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the cliff top and strolled into Corniglia I didn&#39;t want to leave. Ever. In a trip where we&#39;ve seen over a dozen of picturesque little towns, this was the new #1. The village square was full of little shops selling fruit, general store type supplies and postal services. Across the square were bars, coffee shops and restaurants tempting me inside. Narrow side streets house artisans selling wine, leather goods and paintings. There was even a gelato shop with a framed picture of Rick Steves himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of wandering around the village, Cindy reminded me we were there to hike, so we set off northeast toward Vernazza. It wasn&#39;t long before we started to climb, and boy did we ever climb! The path turned into steps, then the steps turned into bare rocks. I really had to focus on each step while we scrambled up and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s another thing the guidebooks don&#39;t really mention. This is a proper hike, not a gentle stroll through the countryside. While the trail is well marked with red and white blazes, it&#39;s not a groomed trail as such. The path is strewn with rocks and loose gravel and can get really narrow at points, so hikers travelling in opposite directions need to take turns on the trail. But every time I&#39;d feel like the hike was getting too hard, we&#39;d come up to a viewpoint that took my breath away. We were perched on the ridge like eagles, high above the villages, so we could see Corniglia and Manarola behind us, and Monterosso far off in the distance ahead. And if we looked down, we&#39;d see fishing boats and ferries out on the water. It was magnificent and completely worth the hard work of hiking up to these viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of hard hiking, we came across a cluster of buildings, including a small bar. Heaven! I thought we had made it to Vernazza early but a sign tempered my spirits. This was the half way point! Ah well. We savoured two amply priced glasses of cold, fresh fruit juice at a tiny black bistro table at the edge of a cliff, enjoyed the huge views and warm sunshine, then continued on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vernazza is right down on the water, so we descended down, down, down to the village. While we were still well above the castle at the end of town, we encountered more and more hikers, but they seemed to go just high enough to get a selfie above the castle, before joining us on the trail into town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t linger too long in Vernazza. It was now 1:00, and the village square was filling up with tourists who came on the train or via bus tours. I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like here in July and August; it was crowded enough for me in mid-April. Quite the change from morning in Corniglia. We ate our picnic lunch beside the marina, climbed to the top of the castle overlooking the harbour, and found the trail to Monterosso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Vernazza is on the water. Monterosso is also on the water. So you&#39;d think a trail between the two villages would also be along the water, right? But oh no. The trail is high, high, up on a ridgeline along the mountain that sits between the two villages. So up we climbed. Up, up, up until my heart was pounding and the afternoon sun was baking my eyebrows. It was a real lung buster, but worth it. The views were amazing once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leg of the trail is much narrower than Cornigla -- Vernazza leg, and the trail was more crowded too, so it was a stop/start hike as we paused to let southbound traffic pass. It took us two full hours to get to Monterosso, but we were lucky in a way. The descent into Monterosso is via the longest staircase I&#39;ve ever seen. It was like the steps in the Mines of Moria in the Lord of the Rings. They just went on and on. But at least they were steps! The southbound hikers had to deal with the rock ledges we climbed to get out of Vernazza. I don&#39;t think I could descend on them with the rubber legs I had now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We congratulated ourselves on our hiking prowess by soaking our feet at the beach (what a treat!) and some extra fine gelato. Then we toodled through the village for a while before catching the train back to La Spezia, tired, sore and very, very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we decided to check out La Spezia a little closer. We found a nice little coffee shop where I could get a real Italian cappuccino and, further up the block, a real Italian macchiato. We found a phone store to get an Italian SIM card for the phone, then headed to the central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The La Spezia market is a big one. Two blocks square, with a large undulating roof over the entire complex. Everything you need is inside. Fruit stands, vegetable stands, cheese and dairy carts, butchers, florists, bakers and fishmongers. And as we&#39;ve seen everywhere else, shops and bars and restaurants surrounding the market on all four sides. It was beautiful and once we found the market we went every day, even though it was a 30 minute walk from our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love our Farmer&#39;s Market at home (heck, I took bread to the market for two years at the same time I was trying to build Orange Boot), but compared to what we see in Europe, from the largest city to the smallest town, our market in Regina sucks. I already know I&#39;m going to cry when I get home and try to shop again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, we live in the middle of nowhere, 1000km from BC fruit or 2000km from California veggies. But surely to God we can put a roof over our market so the food doesn&#39;t get soaked in the rain. And put up a wind screen while we&#39;re at it. And if I&#39;m going to dream, run enough power that the butchers can bring raw meat and keep it cool, and the cheesemongers can do the same with their dairy products. I&#39;ll set up my oven in the market too, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The La Spezia market is busy. Really busy. Busier than the number of people who live and work around it. I saw bus after bus drop off people with empty shopping bags and pick them up again, loaded up with produce for the next day (or maybe two, tops.) Nobody here asks &amp;quot;will it freeze&amp;quot;. They shop every day and eat fresh food and I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once we had our packs full of picnic fare, we got on the bus too and headed to the town of Lereci. If the Gulf of Poets is a U, and La Spezia is at the base of the U, then Lereci is at the end of the left arm. Our host Alice recommended the beach there, and after our massive hike yesterday I was in the mood for a mellow afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride out was a blast. We got the last two seats at the back of the bus, just before the bus was jam packed with university students. And I mean packed. They just kept getting on, handing their packs to four young ladies in the seat in front of us, then started hugging each other to save space. I&#39;ve never seen such a crush. For the longest time, nobody got off the bus, but four more people got on at each stop. More students. An old lady with bags of shopping. Some construction workers. I have no idea how they fit or where they went. But one by one, over the next 20 minutes, the bus would stop, someone would hand over a backpack from the pile, and the bus slowly thinned out. Then it was our turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lereci is beautiful. A lovely horseshoe cove with a castle at one end, a marina, and a long, curving, sandy beach that went all the way to San Terenzo, the next village on the way back to La Spezia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked to the top of the castle (gotta climb a little!) and gazed out across the Gulf to La Spezia in the distance, and Porto Venere at the other end of the U. It was beautiful but also very windy. I wanted to sketch and paint up there but I couldn&#39;t control my sketchbook in the wind, so we retreated down to the marina and checked out the shops lining the quay. Then we went for a sit at the beach and I tried not to compare the bronze sunbathers to the rotisserie chicken I saw at the market in La Spezia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Lereci has the best gelato I&#39;ve had so far. The local flavour, called Lereci, of course, ticks all the boxes. Coffee, nuts, caramel, chocolate all swirled around in some basic crema gelato. Amazing. Until this point my favourite was pistachio (made with real pistachios of course) but now I&#39;m ruined. Hopefully some other local flavour will win my heart down the road, but I&#39;m not holding out much hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in La Spezia, we took the bus to the other end of the U, to Porto Venere. Another spectacular fishing village with a lovely marina, two churches and even a castle on the hill. Porto Venere is really tucked in there tight between the water and the cliffs, so that getting past the first row of houses required some serious climbing. But there were spectacular views around every corner, so we kept on climbing and being wowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was getting on in the afternoon, but we weren&#39;t ready to leave the Cinque Terre yet. Cindy had read about a big hike from Porto Venere to the first Cinque Terre village, Riamaggiore. 12km, 4 hours and listed as &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; difficulty. The same book said the hikes we did two days ago were &amp;quot;easy-moderate.&amp;quot; Hmmm. Well it was a nice day, we felt good and it was at least 5 hours till sunset, so we decided to go for it. We&#39;d abandon our return bus tickets, do the hike and catch the train back to town from Riomaggiore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it was the best hike I&#39;ve ever done. Way harder than I imagined; we climbed 500m pretty much straight up, then followed the ridge line around two separate mountains, before descending through vineyards and farms to the village at Riomaggiore. As we twisted up the mountains, through forests, then out on bare rock ledges, then back into forests, we had these wild views of Porto Venere, then La Spezia and Lereci across the Gulf to our right, then the wider Mediterranean off our left shoulder, then finally Riamaggiore below us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we entered Riamaggiore we were sore, tired and grimy. But the tour buses were long gone, the village was beautiful and we saw the most amazing sunset from a brick lane above Riamaggiore&#39;s tiny harbour. It was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t imagine ever finding a place more beautiful than this. But I&#39;ve said that every day so far on this trip and I&#39;ve been wrong each time. I can&#39;t wait to see what we find next.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Quick Update: I&#39;m Having Too Much Fun To Write!</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi. I&#39;m writing this from the smallest studio apartment I&#39;ve ever stayed in. We figure it&#39;s 200 square feet, including the bathroom. Smaller than most people&#39;s bedrooms, I bet. But it&#39;s in the Montparnasse neighbourhood in Paris and we&#39;ve never been happier. The power was out for 14 hours last night (just in our apartment). Didn&#39;t care. We just went out and when we got back, lit some candles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last long story I wrote was about our week in Madrid. I&#39;ll get back to those longer stories, but here&#39;s a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the train to Barcelona, which is the coolest city every. My favourite on the trip so far. We went out for tapas with our new friends Gillian and Brian (Gillian is the daughter of our friend Laverne) and had a great time. Then Cindy and I walked all over the place, from the Park Gaudi, through the Gracia neighbourhood and to the beach. Then we did it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re done going to cathedrals because we&#39;ve been to the best. The Sagrada Familia is still under construction (started in 1882, should be done in 10 years or so) but is so amazing, so spectacular that I&#39;m still overwhelmed by the beauty of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bummer: on our last night in Barcelona, I walked into a coffee bar to watch the last 10 minutes of El Clasico on TV. Put my pack down to pay for coffee, took a sip, and my pack was gone. My passport was in the pack. That made things more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going to the police department and filing a report, we continued as normal, taking the train into France. First destination was Arles, in Provence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arles was cold and rainy, but we had a large, warm, rustic apartment that was incredibly romantic. We hung out for a few days and took a vacation from our vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arles is a neat city because they have a Roman Arena that is still being used for bullfights, and a Roman Theatre that is being restored too. (They backed Julius Caesar.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arles, we realized this passport problem was going to throw a wrench into things. I thought we could get a new one at the consulate in Nice, but I had to go to the embassy in Paris instead. Ugh. So we pulled out the map and started tweaking our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another great AirBnb apartment in Avignon. It was a great home base to get some laundry done and eat several roast chicken meals from the deli across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Avignon and Arles are on the banks of the Rhone River. One day in Avignon we walked across the bridge to an island in the middle of the Rhone, then rented bikes and rode the 16km around the island. We went through villages, farms, and acres and acres of orchards. The peach trees were blooming too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered around the town for a couple of days then took a bus ride out to Pont du Gard, an amazing triple decker Roman Aqueduct. The best aqueduct so far, and we&#39;ve seen a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we took the TGV train to Paris. Aw shucks. There&#39;s worse places to be stuck without a passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re in love with Paris! Cindy is getting weepy she&#39;s smiling so much. The architecture. The parks. The amazing shops and bakeries and cafes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s without a doubt the most expensive city we&#39;ve ever seen, a real budget bomber, but we&#39;re eating well and zipping about on the metro. I think we&#39;ll splurge at one of the cafes tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick note. Before we left we watched this great show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/what-phils-having/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;ll have what Phil&#39;s having&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on PBS. Awesome show. Romantic, interesting and compelling travel show. But it should be called &amp;quot;I can&#39;t afford what Phil&#39;s having&amp;quot;! We went to all his haunts in Paris but one (still need to find the falafel stand) and it&#39;s crazy what things cost. His favourite roast chicken will set you back $150. Vegetables, drinks, and likely plates and forks are extra. Jeez. But we&#39;re finding great food our own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passport issue is fixed (if you pay enough fees and penalties, things get done fast, and my friends Curt and Bob helped from back home) so we&#39;re heading back south on Thursday. Spring has sprung here, but it&#39;s still pretty chilly at night. Time for some Riviera sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;re all caught up. We&#39;re having so much fun and seeing so many amazing things that when we get back to the apartment we just fall into a heap. And it turns out I get motion sick on trains when I try to read or type (I thought I&#39;d write on the train.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got a few emails where people were worried, so I had to get a quick dispatch out. We&#39;re good. Really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Madrid: The Trains In Spain Go Hurtling &#39;Cross The Plain</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After one more trip around our favourite street in Córdoba, which was deserted after all the Holy Wednesday festivities, we hiked back to the station for our train to Madrid. We had booked on the bullet-nosed high speed train and I was a little excited for the trip. After all the bus rides we were finally travelling the &#39;European Way&#39;. And a fast train, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ea2GDbfI_x-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ea2GDbfI_x-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun ride. We were quickly up to a top speed of 270 km/h for our two hour ride to Madrid. It didn&#39;t feel much faster than normal highway driving, except when I tried to see something outside or, heaven forbid, snap a picture. Then you realized we were passing things at a very great speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pCh4WOhGol-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/pCh4WOhGol-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These plains in Spain are quite beautiful. I remember hearing somewhere they get lots of precipitation and it shows. Lots of trees dotting green pastures, with sheep and goats and later, cows. Quite honestly, it was a lot like the plains at home, except for the rocky outcroppings that dotted the landscape. And then the train slowed, we rolled past industrial areas, then apartment blocks, then we were in Madrid. We went from the train to the metro, got off at the Bilbao station and found our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, all these cities are old and romantic and beautiful. But like all cities it seems, they continue to grow, and there isn&#39;t the investment in aesthetics anymore. We passed mile after mile of the same ugly, tiny windowed, balcony-less brick apartment blocks on the way into Madrid and they looked like a sad and dreary place to live. Compared to the centre of Madrid, it was shockingly horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As late as the 1920&#39;s, Madrid was still doing strong city planning, as witnessed in the glorious Grand Via. But that seems to have stopped in current times, outside of the centre of the city. Which is a shame. And totally consistent with home, although it doesn&#39;t feel like we do much planning in the centre at home either. But the centre of Madrid is glorious, so let&#39;s go back there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pension for the next five nights was the Pension Antonio, on Calle de la Palma. It was tiny and spare but quiet and clean and centrally located, between the Royal Palace to the east and the Prado Museum to the west, with lots of bars and restaurants and stores in between. It was just fine and cheap enough to recommend to others, although be warned that the last two blocks to the apartment feel pretty sketchy to walk down. But that&#39;s just the prairie boy in me reacting to the corrugated steel grates in front of the closed shops and the excessive, monotonous, ugly graffiti. I like Banksy and all, and some businesses pre-empted things by hiring an artist to spray paint their doors in advance, but holy crap it&#39;s just endless here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest thing that hit me about Madrid is that we were in a really big city. Really big. I looked it up and Madrid&#39;s population is 3.5 million people, which makes the largest city we&#39;ve been to by far. You could tell the difference. No narrow, winding streets here. Instead we had long, grand boulevards, with six lanes of cars and huge fountains and statues in the roundabouts. And masses, and masses of people. Even when we were out looking for something to eat at 9PM, the sidewalks were packed with people doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were in Madrid for Easter Weekend, which meant that some of the stores were open irregular hours, but most all of the bars and restaurants were open. And boy oh boy are there ever a lot of bars and restaurants! I&#39;ve never seen so many places packed that tightly before. Every single street was packed with places big and small. We found a really good sandwich shop on Calle Pez and a gourmet pizza place nearer Bilbao station and lots of bakeries and fruit stands to keep our backpacks stocked up. But there were more than enough people to keep them all going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long weekend and fine weather meant everyone was out enjoying their time off, so we loaded up our backpacks and joined the fray. We walked west toward the Plaza d&#39;Espana, with its huge foutain at one end and massive statue at the other. It&#39;s a very impressive square, surrounded by regal offices and fancy hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal circuit has one walking left to the Royal Palace, but we went right to walk through a fine little park. We were surprised to see a stone temple on a hill in the middle of the park so went up to take a closer look. I assumed it was a Roman temple, but when we walked inside there were Egyptian hieroglyphs on the wall. What? We went looking for a pamphlet to figure out what we were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Temple of Debod is a real Egyptian temple, but in Madrid. When the Egyptians built the Aswan Dam in the 1960&#39;s, many ancient temples and tombs were submerged. This temple was dismantled and moved to Madrid instead. Very interesting, but a little out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the temple was a gondola that gave rides to a large nature reserve right near the heart of the city. The line wasn&#39;t too long this holiday morning so we took a ride over. The views back to the city centre were amazing and the park itself was very nice. Lots of bikers and joggers running up the hill that we rode to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we went to the Royal Palace, along with twenty thousand other people. The palace was quite nice but it was a real crush of people, so we hung back a bit and wandered through two statue filled parks that surrounded the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept up the park theme the next day, Good Friday. We hiked east from our room, behind the Prado Museum and the National Library to Paque de El Retiro. This huge space is where thousands upon thousands of Madrilenos go on their days off and this war, sunny spring day was no exception. We started at the formal north end of the park, with formal gardens and a large man-made lake. There were dozens of rowboats on the lake and a very long line of people waiting to rent one. We walked around to the east side and watched the boats from a large plaza, complete with lion statues looking over the boaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we strolled past two smaller palacios and another formal garden which contained Madrid&#39;s oldest tree (planted in the 1650&#39;s.) But I was mesmerized by the &amp;quot;cabin for the association of retired men&amp;quot;, a rustic wooden lodge with a few dozen old fellows playing chess on the patio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south side of the park was more informal, with lots of benches and grassy slopes just begging to be lied down on. So we did, after eating our picnic lunch. We deserved a rest; we&#39;d been walking a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we love toodling through parks, Madrid is home to some excellent museums and it didn&#39;t seem right to ignore them. The Prado Museum has free entry from 6PM - 8PM so at around 5:30 we went looking for the entrance. There was already around 100 people in line, but it looked manageable, so we queued up. We were at the side door, and it wasn&#39;t long before our line bumped into an even longer line for the main door. There must&#39;ve been 2000 people in all, at least. It was huge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, the Prado is even huger, and we all fit in with no problem and, aside from the &#39;big 3&#39; paintings, there wasn&#39;t even a crowd. Sorry, no pictures were allowed, but it really was a fun time. We had a New York Times article outlining the preferred order to see the museum&#39;s highlights, which we followed and really felt like experts. My favourite paintings were by the Dutch Masters - we went through that gallery twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big gallery, the Reina Sofia, is focused on Cubist and Surrealist paintings by the likes of Picasso, Dali and Joan Miro. But I was there for one painting: Picasso&#39;s masterpiece &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot;. It&#39;s fair to say that &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot; is the reason I wanted to go to Madrid. It&#39;s a massive painting, a protest painting for the bombing of women and children during the Spanish Civil War and I am so very happy I got to see it live and in person. It was even better than I thought it would be. (Although, I was very surprised that I didn&#39;t enjoy the Dalis more.)&lt;/p&gt;

Photos aren&#39;t allowed in the gallery!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m embarrassed to say I don&#39;t know much about the Spanish Civil War, other than Franco won, the Germans tested their arms in Spain prior to invading Poland, and Hemingway was there. The &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot; gallery helped me learn a bit more about it. The painting was commissioned by the Republican (in power, but lost the war) government for the 1939 World Expo, to help raise awareness of what was happening in Spain, and hopefully get some assistance. In the gallery, there was a replica of the pavilion where the painting was first shown, along with posters of the time and other reflections on the costs of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a very interesting display showing Picasso&#39;s progression as he worked on the painting. His partner at the time was a photographer and she took a series of shots of this massive mural during its development. There was also a room full of &#39;post script&#39; paintings where Picasso continued to develop the themes within the painting. Fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between parks, art galleries, the classic Atocha train station and strolling down wide boulevards admiring the architecture, we had a wonderful few days in Madrid. We found a tiny square near our room which we adopted as &#39;our square&#39;, since it had the perfect combination of restaurants, ice cream, coffee, newsstands and bookshops. It even had an art supply store! So it seemed like we ended up at our square at least once per day, at least to end our day with coffee and hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter Sunday was a big thrill for me. Before we left Cindy told me about the Sunday stamp market in Plaza Mayor so even though it was Easter we decided to see if it was on. And boy was it ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaza Mayor is the classic town square of Madrid. It&#39;s completely enclosed by four connected banks of buildings but the open square inside is huge and holds thousands of people. Usually the square is full of tables from the surrounding restaurants, and they were still there. But on Sunday&#39;s there are also 50 or so tables full of stamp, coin, postcard and bottle cap dealers out selling their wares. And since it was Easter Sunday, there were also a few thousand people in the middle of the square watching the final Easter procession of the season. All drummers putting on a show. So the square was loud and boisterous and I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent an hour wandering around the tables, regretting I didn&#39;t collect Spanish stamps. And regretting my suitcase wasn&#39;t big enough to start collecting Spanish stamps! But I bought a set as a souvenir that would fit inside my notebook for protection and left it at that. Big fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Madrid we walked down to the train station for a day trip to Toledo. After four days in this massive, crowded city we needed some space. Toledo is a beautiful old walled city, perched high on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding valley, just 70km from Madrid. We were there in 30 minutes by train and had a wonderful afternoon climbing the hill and once again wandering through narrow, twisting streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing I&#39;ll remember most is the nature trail we found that went around the base of the city along the river that passes Toledo. We spent an hour or so walking along the river, watching the fishermen and the couples necking on benches, with sheer rock walls across the water to our right and the walled city above us to our left. And then, because we had time, we hiked back up to the city, up the incredibly steep stone staircase that passed through the walls, for some gelato before walking back down and across the river to the train station.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Córdoba:  Processions, Patios and Pails of Snails</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had tickets on our traditional noon bus northwest to Córdoba, but first we had to get out of Granada. On our walk yesterday, we walked west, away from downtown, and away from the tourist area, into a regular neighbourhood. There we found a delightful neighbourhood pastelaria, with great coffee, a bin full of oranges for juice and pan integral (whole wheat bread) for toast. Now all we had to do is find it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is a double edged sword. That little black box in my pocket, playfully named Big Black Olaf, is crucial for finding our way around the narrow, twisting streets of medieval European cities. Paper maps just don&#39;t cut it; the streets are smaller than the names, making them impossible to label properly. But Big Black Olaf, along with the maps.me app, can get me anywhere, and can get me back there again. But only if I pin the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s where the trouble began. We had such a delightful time yesterday, but I forgot to pin the location on the map. So this morning, all we knew is that it was &amp;quot;west&amp;quot; and about a kilometre from our apartment. Past that big fountain with the plaza running &amp;quot;south&amp;quot;, but before the large park with the running track and old men playing bocce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But was it before, or after, the university residences with raised gardens full of rosemary and walls full of political graffiti? What about the roundabout with tapas bars we were at last night? Surely it&#39;s not that far away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we walked, and walked, and squabbled a little. When we tried to piece together our walk from the day before, we came up with two completely different orders. And I&#39;ll admit to you, like I admitted to Cindy on the day, that I&#39;m not at my best without my morning coffee. So I caused a scene and we had a spat and then we looked up and there it was, across the street. Argh. I got my coffee and Cindy got her juice and we bought make up toast and four make up sandwiches for the bus ride and then quietly walked back to the room to get our bags and get on the bus for the bus depot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride to Córdoba was smooth and pleasant, helped along by the sandwiches and Spanish Gravol. Outside, the landscape was beautiful. As we came out of the mountains, the miles and miles and miles of olive orchards gave way to gently rolling hills and wheat fields. Wheat fields! It was a sunny day and the wheat was already well along, creating a bright green carpet that popped against the bright blue afternoon sky. Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maps.me was in a good mood today, and picked a walking route to our guest room that passed through two parks. No major freeways for us! So we had a delightful walk to our room and for the first time, arrived feeling upbeat about our surroundings. (So far, our locations needed a day to grow on us.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest room for the next three nights was in Manuela&#39;s house and it was a real treat. We had a huge, elaborately decorated room and a very large tiled bathroom with double sinks even. There were so many statuettes and icons around the room, so many armoires and dressers and side tables, so many tablecloths and doilies and other fabrics that we put our towel underneath our suitcases lest we get anything dirty. Perhaps the decor was better suited to an older couple, but we had a ton of space and Manuela was very nice. I think our Spanish was improving because our charades went more easily as we learned about all the keys and locks and how the doors work. We could even share pictures of the snowstorm back home and agreed things were better in Córdoba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room was about 1km outside of the main tourist area and that&#39;s a very good thing. We kept discovering tiny fruit shops and cafes and gelaterias down side alleys that didn&#39;t even have signs out front. You couldn&#39;t tell they were there until you walked down the alley, so of course we walked down all the alleys and made sure we found them all. But wow was it tight. I measured our street, and wall to wall, including two &#39;sidewalks&#39; and the road, was eleven feet wide. When a car came down the road we hugged the wall and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we felt claustrophobic, we&#39;d walk two blocks to a small thoroughfare with wider sidewalks and more shops. This was our breakfast street every day. Friendly people, big glasses of orange juice, tiny glasses of strong coffee and tostadas. I discovered the local custom of spreading puréed tomatoes on my toast instead of jam and it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down this street is the main square. Bars and restaurants ring the outside with City Hall in the middle. Then we turned the corner around City Hall and found Roman pillars! There were the remains of a Roman temple right beside City Hall! Amazing. While not as complete as the temple in Evora, it was still quite spectacular and a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the main square was blocked off for Easter processions, so we turned left and headed down to the Mesquita. It&#39;s a Mosque/Cathedral that is the centrepiece of tourism in Córdoba, but for now we just walked around it, through the winding alleys of the Jewish quarter and headed to the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Córdoba is situated alongside the Guadalquivir River, which makes it a very strategic city, ever since Roman times. The Romans built a beautiful bridge across the river right near where the Mesquita now stands and as it was gorgeous evening, we strolled along the bridge for almost an hour, watching the ducks in the river, looking at the remains of windmills from Roman times, taking photos in the amazing evening light and watching the thousands of fellow tourists doing exactly the same thing. It was the start of Easter Break, so we saw our first busloads of high school and university students on a tour of Spain. It added to the overall energy level in the place, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is still city on the other side of the bridge, there isn&#39;t a whole bunch, so I could still see the rolling hills and green wheat fields in the distance, which warmed my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued our stroll along the river then headed back to our neighbourhood to find a place for supper. Just like in Granada, we stumbled across a crowd in front of one of the cathedrals, filling the whole plaza / intersection. Easter procession! So we hung out for a while, tried to chat with our neighbours, watched the children having fun and watched the police try to re-route traffic, including a massive tour bus that clearly made a wrong turn at some point. And then, just like Granada, the crowd dispersed before anything happened. Procession&#39;s suspended, someone said. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we took care of business. It was laundry day, so I googled the nearest laundromat and we headed away from downtown, 1km across the train tracks. It&#39;s another one of those big differences from Regina. At home, walking to a public laundromat, 1km across the tracks, is a scary bit of business. Sea Spray laundry at home isn&#39;t a lot of fun and certainly not a place I&#39;d want to hang out. But boy were we ever surprised in Córdoba!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we had to cross the tracks. But we couldn&#39;t find the tracks! Rather than the ugliness that splits downtown Regina and the Warehouse District, here they built a hill over the tracks, so the trains ran underground from the station to the outskirts of town. And on top of the hill, they built parks! And planted trees, and installed sculptures and fountains! It was gorgeous and something we totally need to do at home. I&#39;m forwarding pictures to my city councillor and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&#39;t want to insult Sea Spray Laundry, but this laundromat was gorgeous. Spotless. Self Service. With automatic soap and softener dispensing so we didn&#39;t even need to buy soap. So we loaded up, set a timer on the phone and went for a walk around the neighbourhood. It was so pretty. Just your friendly neighbourhood shopping district, with butcher shops and fruit shops and fish shops and pharmacies and banks and anything else you&#39;d need. Friends meeting on the corner to say hi. Children out for a walk with their grandparents. We wandered around with our mouths open, staring at how awesome it all was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our imagined need for private, detached houses with big yards at home means there just aren&#39;t enough people to support this level of commerce in a neighbourhood. At least that&#39;s what the real estate folks keep telling us. But these blocks of four story buildings with apartments and offices above stores on the ground floor sure look good to me. And everyone seemed happy enough. And Manuela&#39;s apartment is huge too. Massive even. Bigger than I need, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh yeah, I forgot to mention. Córdoba is full of courtyards and inner patios! One of the reasons the streets are so narrow is to maximize courtyard space. We walked by some beauties. They have an annual &#39;patio walk&#39; in Córdoba, similar to our &#39;Secret Garden Tour&#39; at home. I&#39;d love to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, on our way to supper, we came across another procession right near our room. And there were purple hats too! This one actually happened and it was quite a bit of fun. The crowd was smaller than in Granada, but still big enough to make us find an alternate route to supper. We&#39;d learn to call this a small crowd before the week was out. But as we drank wine and ate tapas, we watched the TV and got a hint of the fervour these processions cause all over Andalucia. The TV had pictures from Seville, Malaga, Cadiz, Huelva, Granada and Córdoba, showing crowds and processions getting underway all across the region. Then it cut to the sad news from Brussels, about which I&#39;ve already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it was time for our tour of the Mesquita. You can get in for free between 8:30AM and 10:30AM, so that&#39;s exactly what we did. Along with 500 other people who got there earlier than we did. No matter though, the Mesquita is massive. 5000 people could be in there and it wouldn&#39;t feel crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has an interesting history. First there was a Romman temple on the site. After the Romans retreated, the Visigoths built a Christian temple on the site. When the Moors conquered Spain, the site was split and Christians and Muslims worshiped side by side. Then in the 8th century, the Sultan in power bought the Christian half and built the largest Mosque in Western Europe on the site. Then, with the Christian re-conquest in the 13th century, a huge cathedral was built inside the Mosque. That is to say, the entire building is a cathedral, but the Christian bits have been added to the Muslim bits. So the whole structure looks rather odd. Muslim architecture but Christian icons, with a Gothic cathedral in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s odd and overwhelmingly spectacular at the same time. We spent two hours looking up and taking pictures that in no way portray the grandeur of the place. Because it&#39;s an active Cathedral and not a museum, there&#39;s very little mention of the Muslim antecedents of the building. However there is a section at the back that has been left in it&#39;s original Moorish state. Plus there is a display of some remains of the Visigoth temple in one corner too. It&#39;s a shame, really, because there is so much layered history here that an interpretive pamphlet would really make the history come alive. There are private tour groups that do this; might be worth your while when you visit. Or read up ahead. Or just enjoy the majesty of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were getting tapas&#39;d out. The effort to interpreting Spanish menus and coming to decisions on what was or was not octopus was tiring us out. And that time I went to what I thought was a coffee shop on the plaza but learned they sold pails of snails really freaked me out. So for supper on our last night in Córdoba we decided in advance to head to the Jewish Quarter beside the Mesquita and find an Arabian place with couscous and chicken tajin. It was Wednesday night and we thought we&#39;d be relatively safe from Easter procession crowds. Boy were we wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to Mesquita from our place is to go down our little &#39;main street&#39;, through the town square, then turn left and head down to the river. But our main street was packed; we could see Mary heading off down the road towards a church. There was no way that would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we took a left and tried to get ahead of the parade. If we could get ahead of the first purple hoods, it was polite to cross the road. So we leaped ahead of Mary&#39;s procession and got to the town square, but that was even more jammed. Jesus had already made it to the town square. So we went further left, parallel to the parade route, until we reached the river, then backtracked and got to the Jewish Quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started looking for a restaurant with couscous and tajin (by that point I was actually craving couscous) but soon realized we were deep into the tourist zone. Too many English menus. Too many burgers. Too many cocktails. And the crowds kept growing and growing. Finally, after an hour of looking, we found a place with couscous on the menu and a table for two just inside the door. We ducked in and tried to ignore all the English being spoken around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon we couldn&#39;t hear the English for all the drumming. Another procession was passing right beside the restaurant! Right by our table, in fact. I pushed outside and grabbed a few pictures between courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &amp;quot;TGI-Couscous&amp;quot; this place wasn&#39;t too bad. We paid and plotted our course for home. There was still a huge crowd at the restaurant. Too big to cross. But the Mesquita was behind us. If we went the long way round the Mesquita maybe we could find open road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we headed out along the south side of the Mesquita and after a while turned right, into a huge crowd of spectators, hooded processioners and a full band. Another procession! They hadn&#39;t really started, so we crossed the street and tried to pass along the crowd on the left. That didn&#39;t really work, so after a block we ducked down a side street and tried walking parallel to the procession again. We got stuck 1/2 a block from the intersection. Just solid people, and too far away to see the procession anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I muttered to Cindy, &amp;quot;the Christians are pushing us back to the river!&amp;quot;, which was happening, albeit unintentionally. But that gave us an idea. We headed to the river, away from our room, then walked along it until we were at least eight blocks past the Mesquita, the town square and even our little &amp;quot;main street.&amp;quot; Then north, then back and safely home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, we saw four different Mary floats and at least three Jesus floats, eight bands and five different colours of hoods. It was quite a night. But my favourite thing of all was the little kids collecting wax balls, drip by drip, from the candles carried by the hooded folk. And the hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, from the very young, to the very old, eating sunflower seeds along the parade route. And by morning, how it was all swept up so there was no way of knowing the processions even happened. But they did. And it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Granada:  Hints of Arabia in Andalucia</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/granada-hints-of-arabia-in-andalucia/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We left Seville with a touch of sadness, a feeling that will no doubt be a part of many departures on this trip. It was off to the bus station for a 3-4 hour trip east and south to Granada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granada is one of the three jewels of Andalucia (the others being Seville and Cordoba) and is the most remote. Well, remote isn&#39;t really accurate, since Granada is a major city and tourist destination, but it is the last major destination still to be served by high speed trains. We passed the new track, still under construction, several times on the trip. But for now it was buses and that was fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape along the trip was dramatic once again. Gone were the orange orchards of Portugal and western Spain. Now it was miles and miles of olive trees, stretching as far as we could see in all directions, through rolling hills and gently twisting roads. Every once in a while, we&#39;d see an especially tall hill. In those cases, there was always a cluster of white walled houses up the side of the hill and a castle and walls on top. I scanned the distant hills for knights on horseback but could never pick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to Granada we started to climb. Bare rocky outcrops thrust out of the ground. First a single mountain, then a group, and then we were fully in the mountains. Granada lies in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains and as we pulled into the city we could see snow covered peaks off in the distance. I learned that there&#39;s quite a nice ski resort off in those mountains, even though it was 15c in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room for the next three nights was the barest of the trip so far. It was basically a spare bedroom and access to the bathroom, in the house of Rafa and David, two young artists. They were very nice, the room was warm and the bed comfortable, and the location, right beside the main cathedral, was excellent. Even though we didn&#39;t really see them very much, we didn&#39;t feel comfortable hanging out in their house. So we were out on the street from morning till bedtime most days. When we came back to our room to dry off and warm up, we were often visited by their skinny black cat, who quite enjoyed my backpack for some reason. I have claw marks as a souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granada is a very interesting city in that it was the last stronghold of Moorish (Muslim) rule in Spain. When the Christian crusaders invaded the Iberian peninsula around 1200AD, they came from the north and conquered cities like Seville and Córdoba, but took much longer to get south and east to Granada. In fact, it seems like there was acceptance of joint rule of the area for a time. When we were in Seville, I read of a palace in the centre of the city where the ruler hired artisans from all over Spain to work on the building, including Muslim artisans from Granada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of Muslim/Arabic culture is throughout the city but is especially strong in the Arabic quarter, a ghetto of narrow, hilly, twisting streets close to the main avenues. The area is full of tea rooms, hookah lounges and stores selling gorgeous glass lamps, leather goods and silver tea sets. We went to eat in this area twice during our stay, grateful for the delicious vegetable couscous and clay bowls with chicken tajin. But our big discovery was the array of delicious tea in these restaurants. Sweet, creamy concoctions with all kinds of spices. Our favourite was called &#39;sol y nieve&#39;, a strawberry and cinnamon tea with a mountain of whipped cream on top. It was an excellent after dinner selection that I fully intend to make at home somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the Arabic quarter we strolled along the river, along cobblestone plazas full of restaurants and bars. Then we turned left and began to climb up a very steep hillside until we came to a lookout with great views of the city, the main cathedral (right by our room) and the fields and mountains beyond. And a spectacular view of the jewel of Granada, the Alhambra. This amazing palace, castle and garden sits high on the hill on the other side of the river, looming proudly over the city below. It was the last stronghold of Muslim rule in Europe and we were going to tour it tomorrow. But for now, we just looked across the valley and admired the grand structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the Alhambra is a major attraction, the authorities control how many people get in each day. They accept 6000 visitors per day and you can buy either a morning ticket or an afternoon ticket. And each ticket has a specific time where you can visit the Nazrid Palace, the high point of the trip. So on the bus ride into town, we bought &#39;morning&#39; tickets for the next day, with a 1:30PM entry into the Nazrid Palace. We didn&#39;t know it at the time, but we were very lucky. All tickets for the entire weekend we were in Granada were sold out by the time we went to the tourist office to pick up our tickets, three hours after we booked them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we grabbed an early breakfast and hiked up to the entrance of the Alhambra, trying to get a jump on the tour busses. It was a steep hike, but thanks to a tip from the lady at the ticket office yesterday, we did all our climbing at the start. We begin the tour at the Generalife Garden at the high point of the grounds, and strolled pretty much downhill from there. The massive formal garden was built as a place for the sultans to relax when life in the palace got too hectic. So long as we paced ourselves well between the Italian tour and the Japanese tour, we could get a sense of the tranquil nature of the place. I also got a thrill looking at the vegetable gardens that were neatly laid out on terraces below the formal garden. After days of orange-red or white soil, it was nice to see some deeper colour in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the gardens it was a nice stroll through a tiny village within the walls. There were some restaurants and souvenir shops but also a small shop where two men made very elegant and ornate boxes, platters, chess sets and backgammon boards. The were all intricately inlaid with different types of wood and then heavily lacquered. They were gorgeous and priced to reflect the hours of work that went into each piece. Beautiful but outside my budget, alas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked past a small, nondescript building then backtracked to read the small sign and finally went in. I&#39;m glad we did, since the building was the remains of a hammam, or Muslim bathhouse. It was a cluster of small rooms with curved doorways and with start shaped holes cut through the roof to let the light in. Deep, dark and mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were into our first example of the layering of history. When the Christians finally defeated the Moors in Granada, they took over the Alhambra complex and started converting it to a Christian palace. The first addition was a large cathedral in the middle of the site. Later it was followed by a massive palace, built for King Carlos V, in the middle of the main square. Our guidebook mentioned that the palace has divided opinion over the years. It&#39;s either an excellent example of 18th century architecture or an abomination in the middle of the Moorish aesthetic. Well, it doesn&#39;t look like anything else around it, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a pattern evolving here that is interesting and a little sad. It&#39;s one of conquest and re-conquest all over this part of Europe, but is really apparent with structures like the Alhambra. Romans - Goths - Moors - Christians, and in the case of the Christian re-conquest, a need to rework the architecture to get rid of, or at least downplay, the Moorish influence. And then there&#39;s Napoleon. When the French invaded Spain they used the Alhambra as a barracks and nearly blew it up in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes up again and again in this region. When the Moors are conquered their architecture is changed, then Napoleon comes and nearly wrecks everything. Then, thankfully, someone recognizes the historical (and touristical) importance of these treasures and they are restored and a ticket office put in front. And I don&#39;t mind the ticket offices one bit because these are beautiful, beautiful places and deserve to be restored and celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the Alhambra, it was the American Washington Irving who is credited for opening people&#39;s eyes to the amazing Alhambra. He lived in Granada for a while after Napoleon left and the Alhambra was falling into disrepair. His writing about the place inspired the restoration work. Hopefully this writing inspires you to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tour before our time in the palace was the Alcazaba. This castle / walled area was the oldest part of the complex and afforded more incredible views of the city as well as the lookout we sat on last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stood in line we met a foursome from Ontario who were travelling through Spain in the reverse order we were, but they were driving the whole way. I was amazed and a little dumbfounded, especially as they told me about taking wrong turns through the centre of Seville. Why anyone would choose to drive through these places when you could walk or take the transit is beyond me. They also told me they booked their tickets to Alhambra over a month ago, so I guess we were lucky to get ours the day before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was our time to visit the Nazrid Palace. What a stunner. It was more elaborate and ornate than I imagined, but subdued too. When I think of a palace I think of precious metals or gems (I&#39;ve not seen many palaces, but that&#39;s what I think!) but the Nazrid is amazing for different reasons. It&#39;s more about the artisans that built it. Every square inch of some walls are covered in ornate plaster carvings and Arabic script. Some ceilings have even more elaborate plaster domes, giving the impression of a starry night. Other halls had domed ceilings of stretched leather, which was then painted into elaborate patterns. The palace tour was an incredible climax to an already amazing tour of the grounds. It&#39;s well worth the trip to Granada to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last full day in Granada was Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week or Semana Santa in Spain. The entire week is a huge holiday in Spain, a combination of mourning and partying at the same time. The week starts off with a big procession, mourning the death of Jesus and Mary&#39;s sorrow. We had heard about these processions and were very excited to see one in person. Although, truth be told, it was a bit of a mystery as to where and when the procession would happen. Many of the central squares had been blocked off and large sets of bleachers installed, but as the day went on an we walked around the city, we never saw anyone sitting in the bleachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at around 4pm, we saw more and more people heading off in the same direction, away from the bleachers, so we followed along. Soon we came to a different cathedral, with hundreds of people packed tight around the cathedral doors and sort of making a path down the block. I say &#39;sort of&#39; because there&#39;s no such thing as an orderly line in Spain. But it seemed possible that we had made it to the procession route. Laughable attempts to communicate with the man standing next to me confirmed that the procession would start at the cathedral in about an hour. We had stumbled on front row seats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stood there, more and more people squeezed past us, even though I was sure there was no way more people could fit in this square. Our colourful Canadian outerwear must&#39;ve screamed &amp;quot;This Way Through&amp;quot; because everyone seemed to pass beside or between us, even if we linked arms. A gaggle of teenage girls. Teenage boys with the most incredible Justin Beiber pompadours. Mothers with strollers. Old men with walkers. I&#39;m not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it started to rain. Out came 1000 umbrellas, or in our case, up went hoods. We would&#39;ve stayed dry except that, without umbrellas, we were in the drip line of all our neighbours. Then slowly people started leaving. The procession was suspended, for how long nobody new, due to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were disappointed, but also wet and cold so we went back to our room to change clothes and warm up. We were just about to head out for supper when we heard drums and horns and followed the music to the main cathedral. There it was! The procession! We hurried over and found a place to stand behind a pair of strollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the procession is supposed to be for mourning, the entire event is quite the celebration. Everyone is dressed up, especially the little children. Vendors with carts selling drinks, candy, snacks (especially sunflower seeds - everyone was eating them, from the schoolchildren to young women to the elderly), balloons and toy drums lined each street. There was a huge amount of anticipation as we waited for the procession to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really was quite a production. First, several dozen marchers disguised in robes and pointed hoods, carrying candles. Then a huge &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; of Jesus, carried by 20-25 young men, hidden underneath. The float was so heavy that every few minutes they&#39;d have to set it down and have a rest, or trade with other men who followed the float.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you see the people holding up the float, behind the screen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the float were ladies of all ages in black mourning dresses and veils, followed by a marching band. Whenever the float was in the air, the band played. When the bearers rested, the drummers kept time. It was a very slow, solemn procession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floats were so large that it was a real challenge to navigate through the narrow streets. Turning corners was especially dramatic. The bearers took two full minutes to slowly rock back, forth and forward to shimmy the huge float 90 degrees. When the job was complete, the crowd clapped and cheered in appreciation as the float headed off down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, a second procession came by. Hooded figures, then an even larger float of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by dozens of large candles. It was very dramatic in the twilight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the Mary float made its way around the corner, we left the crowd and went in the opposite direction to find some supper. Our time in Granada was coming to an end. It&#39;s a beautiful city. The mix of cultures and traditions is very interesting and the history, like everywhere else we&#39;ve been so far, is thick. I just want to sit down with some history books and really get the background on these places. But we keep moving on. Time to pop a few Gravol and head to the bus station...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How Do You Leave A City Like Sevilha?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-do-you-leave-a-city-like-sevilha/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We bid a fond farewell to Portugal in Tavira and climbed on the ALSA bus to Seville. There are no trains between Portugal and Spain this far south, so a four hour bus ride was required. But the ALSA buses are comfortable and they have electrical outlets between the seats so all was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been getting pretty good at these 3-4 hour bus journeys by now. A perfect travel day starts with a 7:30AM alarm. Shower, pack and head off for a breakfast of coffee, orange juice and toast (tostas or toastadas.) If we like the pastelaria we are in, we&#39;ll buy a couple of sandwiches to eat on the bus. Otherwise, we&#39;ll stop somewhere else on the way back to our room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in our room, it&#39;s a quick bathroom break, then pick up our bags and head to the bus station. The perfect departure time is 12 noon, so we aren&#39;t rushed. Then we arrive at our destination by 3 or 4 pm, which is plenty of time to find our room, meet our host, and go for a first walk around town. Especially with Spanish time, this gives us a half day in our new town. Although our hosts think we&#39;re crazy to waken before 10AM for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride into Spain was quite an adventure. We were stopped at the border for over 30 minutes. Inspectors came on board, looked at us sternly, then took the driver off for a while. No passports were checked, but when we stopped for a break in Huelva, a Norwegian passenger I was chatting with said the border inspectors were upset that there were not fasten seat belts signs on the back of every seat. Our bus only had them every six inches and on the window. So the driver was fined 300€ on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&#39;t much of a change in landscape between the eastern Algarve and western Andalucia, but there is a change in agriculture. The orange orchards are replaced by mile after mile of plastic hoop houses. We were too far from the fields to make out what was growing under these greenhouses, but the plants looked happy. With the spacing of the plants my best guess is that they housed young orange trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tranquility of the Algarve, entering Seville was a big culture shock. We exited the bus station on a massive eight lane road, completely jammed with cars, people packing the sidewalks and city busses buzzing by. And the maps.me app gave what seemed like crazy directions to our apartment. We left the busy boulevard soon enough, and seemed to be directed around in circles, twisting and turning through progressively narrower alley ways. At one point we even went through the inner courtyard of a row of buildings, or so it seemed (to be fair, there was a street sign on the wall leading into the courtyard.) But suddenly we popped out into a delightful little square ringed with food shops, walked down a busy street with sidewalks narrower than our suitcases, turned left and were at our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was heaven. Pure heaven I tell you. Seville is the most amazing city, and if we hadn&#39;t agreed in advance to visit other places I would still be there. I don&#39;t think I could see it all in twenty years. Our flat was right near the Plaza Alfalfa (ah, memories of home) and if I never left the square I would still be happy. There were no less than three pastelarias on the square! I know! Plus three restaurants, a charcuterie place, a pharmacy and a playground in the middle. Then in the block between the square and our flat, there was a killer artisan bread bakery (also with coffee, orange juice and amazing pastries), two killer tapas bars (one so small and so constantly busy we never did get a table), a fruit market, a mini super market, and a florist. I&#39;m not exaggerating even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The streets in Seville, at least in the central area, are very narrow and winding. We were continually getting lost, walking for an hour then popping up at Plaza Alfalfa again, or ending up at the Cathedral when we thought we were heading away from the Cathedral. But the great thing is that every single street, and I mean every, single, street is beautiful and interesting and packed with beautiful people. Sevillains (as we called them) are extremely fashion conscious and yet again we felt like frumpy foreigners around them. Had we wanted to, and had the 1000€ it required, we could&#39;ve changed our look in an afternoon. The streets were lined with the most fashionable shops imaginable. Beautiful, colourful, stylish dresses and more suits, in more colours, than I have ever seen. There were many, many specialty clothing stores just for kids too - you can never start too young in Seville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Seville is that it&#39;s tough on photographers. Everything is just so bloody big, it&#39;s impossible to get things in the frame. Seville&#39;s Cathedral is the largest by volume in the world. It took over 100 years to build and let me tell you, it&#39;s a big &#39;un. It took forever to walk around, and would have even if the streets weren&#39;t clogged with tourists. Big, gothic and gaudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seville was the richest city in the world for a time, and it shows. When the Spanish colonized the Americas, Seville was awarded the contract to administer all the wealth coming from the New World. Ships laden with riches made their way up the Guadalquivir River to unload at Seville. So the city is full, and I mean full, of palaces, cathedrals and statues. The University of Seville is also right downtown and the main building is full of marble halls surrounding a massive courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, the most opulent structure in the city is the Plaza de España in Maria Luisa Park, and it&#39;s rather new. The park itself is huge and right downtown, full of statues and fountains and trees and formal pathways. But the Plaza is simply massive. Built in 1928, the plaza is a massive semi circle of connected buildings with a canal in the middle. Bridges connect the centre of the plaza and the outer ring, over the canal. Around the outer ring are a number of alcoves with scenes of Spanish provinces done in tile. We didn&#39;t know anything about the plaza before we stumbled on to it, and let me tell you it was quite a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our time in Seville was spent wandering the streets, looking in shop windows, eating picnic lunches in parks, eating tapas in the evening and generally getting lost. One afternoon we took a pedestrian bridge across the river to the suburb of Triana. At the base of the bridge on the Triana side was a wonderful indoor farmers market (perfect for picking up fruit, bread and Jamon Iberico for our picnic) and a park beside. Lunchtime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The streets of Triana are laid out in a grid, and it seems when the Spanish have room for a grid, they also have room for extra wide plazas. A massive roundabout at the base of another bridge forked into three wide avenues, one of which was pedestrian only. We walked for at least a mile from the roundabout to a fountain at the other end of the plaza, window shopping and finding the perfect gelato along the way. The street was full of happy people, most of which were locals enjoying the sunny afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did more window shopping in Triana than we planned, since it was now 3pm and we were fully into the afternoon siesta time. Most shops in Spain close in the afternoons. They&#39;ll be open from 10AM - 1:30 or 2pm, then close until 5pm or 5:30. Then they&#39;ll stay open till 8 or 9pm. So we gazed in the shop windows and thought of how much money we saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the plaza didn&#39;t empty. Oh, no. The stores closed but the bars were entering into their busiest time of the day. Along the plaza and the side streets were tiny bars full of people, standing shoulder to shoulder and spilling into the street. Businessmen, old ladies, moms with strollers, construction workers. Everyone. And they all had a glass of beer or wine in their hand and a small plate of tapas on the table. Sardines, olives, cheese, ham. Heavenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted for a gelato stand and sat out on the street, watching the world go by. Then we made sure to get a little more to eat too; after two days in Seville we had learned that we wouldn&#39;t be eating supper any time soon. You see, the bars and cafes are for little bites only. For supper you need a restaurant. And restaurants don&#39;t even open until 8pm! The bar/restaurant combo places close from 6-8 too, so make sure you aren&#39;t hungry during the Canadian supper hour, or be sure to pack a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were enjoying the local areas more than the tourist areas, so in our last day in Seville we headed in the opposite direction from our beloved Plaza Alfalfa toward the Alemeda de Hercules. Legend has it Seville was founded by Hercules and this long, wide Avenue celebrates the legend. It took us a while to find it, but the avenue was worth the hunt. Two tall pillars stand at either end of this long pedestrian walkway, with people walking down the middle, cars along the outside, and shops and cafes the whole way along it. It was a smaller version of the Avenue de Liberdores in Lisbon, and not as chic, but we loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we walked back down toward the river, around the bull ring and back toward the Cathedral for the evening. Our waiter at breakfast had recommended some places to eat and hear flamenco. We had a long night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was a restaurant near the Cathedral that offered a private flamenco concert in the back. A drink, tapas and front row seats. This was a professional quartet; a man playing guitar, a young woman and young man who danced, and a matron (who was in reality quite young) who sang. It was an amazing show. Lively, exciting, colourful and full of passion. We were blown away. It was a wonderful show in an intimate venue, but it was quite polished compared to what we saw next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second stop was a small bar closer to our apartment. We nearly missed it. There was a tiny sign over the door that was difficult to notice, but the fact that people kept going in two by two was a hint that something was happening. But inside was empty. Just a grizzled old man in a heavy wool sweater, tending an ancient fireplace just inside the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked past the man and turned down the hallway, following the faint sound of guitar. Then we came into a large, low room, more like a garage out back, with long benches filled with people and a bar off to the side. Flamenco music and male singing was coming from somewhere in this mess but I couldn&#39;t see where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found it. Over in the corner, where only a few people could really see, were three men. They were all seated. The oldest man was about 60 and he played guitar. The man in the middle was younger, say 40 years old and sang. And the man on the left, small, clad all in black, with a pony tail and beard like in a tequila ad, clapped, chanted, then got up and danced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played and danced for 20 minutes or more, while people jockeyed around them for a better view or jockeyed to the bar for another drink. Where the first show was polished and electric, this performance was dark and smoky and passionate. We were swept away by the romance of the whole thing. I should be back there still, sweeping floors, washing glasses and listening to that haunting music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m a family guy at heart so after the performance we left that bar, arm in arm, and just wandered the streets of Seville one last time. It was getting on to midnight now and we started thinking about finding our way home. But then we&#39;d see some people on the corner and would wander by to check out that bar. Or we&#39;d hear music and head down to the next corner. Finally we heard more guitars and more singing, and walked down one more block to a square with three restaurants beside each other. In front of the middle restaurant was a long table with a dozen or more men, all with guitars or mandolins. It looked like a meeting of a local guitar club and they had decided it was time to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how long they had been playing before we got there, but they played for an hour longer at least. One man would sing. One would play a solo. Everyone sang the chorus, with gusto. A few men would come out into the gathered crowd and ask women to dance. Another passed the hat and bought beer for the players wth the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seemed like it wouldn&#39;t end. One or two men would pack up, then 10 would perform a song. The lead singer would come back out from the bar for one more song. Then there were 8 players, then 6, then 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, oh so slowly, the mini-concert ended and we wandered back to Plaza Alfalfa, wishing we could stay in Seville forever. Get cleaned up, buy some fashionable clothes, get jobs in a pastelaria and spend our nights singing and dancing and holding hands in a plaza we never knew existed before and may never find again.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Brussels</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/brussels/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/brussels/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re fine. But I&#39;m a little spooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sitting in a cafe in Córdoba, Spain, having a late lunch, when the TV cut to the bombings in Brussels. As you no doubt know, two bombs went off in Brussels and if I can read Spanish properly, the authorities found a third that failed to go off. Many people dead. In southern Spain, according to the news at least, people are worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the height of their Easter festival here and I would assume it&#39;s prime time for something nasty to happen. Although, personally, I&#39;ll be more worried when we head north in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &#39;the day after&#39; as I write this and things seem normal here, although there are a lot more police patrolling the cathedrals and main tourist areas this morning. We toured the Mosque/Cathedral this they checked our bags before we went in. There were three Muslim fellows in front of us in line and I&#39;m sad to tell you that they made me a little nervous. But I guess that&#39;s what happens when anyone could have a bomb strapped to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men made some other tourists nervous too, mainly with the pictures they were taking. Two tourists talked to security, who then spoke to two police officers (who were walking around with their shotguns out) who then spoke to the Muslim men. We watched for a while as they police gave their papers a very good look. One of the Muslim fellows spoke good Spanish (thank goodness) and had a long, calm conversation with the police officers. We left before it ended but it appeared that everything was going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s not a good time to be Muslim and walking around in Europe. Or from what I&#39;ve read, the USA either. I don&#39;t know about Canada, but I assume it&#39;s not much fun at home too. And I get it, I guess. But there&#39;s something that&#39;s sticking in me, especially because all this is happening when we&#39;re in Córdoba, where the main attraction is the Mosque/Cathedral. After the Roman&#39;s left, this piece of land was a Cathedral in the time of the Visigoths, then a shared Muslim/Christian space, then the largest Mosque in Western Europe, then a Cathedral only. All with a span of 1300 years. Recently, Muslims have been trying to get access to the space to pray again and the Christians aren&#39;t going to let that happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point being that all sorts of people have lived in this land for many, many hundreds of years. Some times one group is in power and the other are suppressed. Then things change and another group is in power. But always someone in power, someone gets the short end. Roman, Visigoth, Muslim, Christian, Monarchist, Republican, Fascist, Republican. It doesn&#39;t matter. Somebody wants to get rich and can justify taking things. Then we justify keeping things, and fearing &#39;the others&#39; until someone comes and takes it from us. It&#39;s true in Spain and it&#39;s true in Saskatchewan. And it makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been walking around a very beautiful city this morning; beautiful specifically because of the mix of cultures who have built this place. And all I can think about is fear and hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can think about is whether humans are doomed to always fear or hate &#39;the others.&#39; And whether we are doomed to be ruled by someone, be it a warlord, King, President, MP, MLA or CEO who gains and keep power by playing on those fears. And what would it take for us all to really, truly, live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll keep on travelling, with our eyes open, and with our hearts open too. And I&#39;ll try really hard not to get nervous just because the guy beside me looks different than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. More light hearted travel fare tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Algarve #3: Chilling Out In Tavira</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/algarve-3-chilling-out-in-tavira/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will: Driving around the southern coast of Portugal, sampling some of the most fantastic beaches in the world; subsisting on oranges, strawberries and dark chocolate for most of the day; arriving in the eastern Algarve town of Tavira and parking in the first lot we could find (as is our habit); then trying to book a guest room for the next three days on your smartphone. By the time we had finally secured a room, it was late, my stomach was growling and I was sunburnt and worn out from all the driving and cliff climbing. So then imagine heading out to find dinner, turning the corner and seeing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a beautiful square, Roman bridge over a still river and a narrow street lined with restaurants to get your blood flowing again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the kids all take bus tours to Lagos to party the night away, mellow baker couples book into a guest house in Tavira for three nights and stroll around the town square and along the river. And that&#39;s exactly what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest room was huge, with a balcony overlooking the Main Street and a large table to sit at. We had a shared bathroom and kitchen area but we were the only people in the entire guest house for two of the nights, so we had more space than we needed. The bed was firm and the WIFI was fast. This room will be the benchmark for many weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first meal in Tavira we relied on our guidebook and the first &amp;quot;single dollar sign&amp;quot; suggestion was Churrasqueria O Manel and it did not disappoint. The specialty of the house is Piri-Piri chicken; Manel&#39;s been grilling it up, over charcoal, every night for over 30 years. We spoke with his daughter who said he developed the recipe from his travels in the Navy as a boy and let me tell you he knows what he&#39;s doing. We gorged ourselves and the next night picked up a bit takeaway for supper at the guest house. Yup, we ate at the same place two nights in a row. It was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tavira gets a lot of tourists and we had our first experience with &#39;tourist pricing&#39; on the trip so far. Our usual breakfast, coffee for me, fresh orange juice for Cindy, and two pastries typically costs between 5 and 6 euros. But it was 10 euros on Tavira&#39;s sunny square. It was fun, but I&#39;ll take the tiny bar in a side street pastelaria any day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The east side of the Algarve doesn&#39;t have the tall cliffs like the southwest coast. Instead, the coast is all marshland and salt flats. They do a nice trade in sea salt in Tavira and area. But they do have beaches, you just need to take a boat to the far side of the lagoon. In the high season there&#39;s a ferry right from the town square, but since this was winter and only a sunny 20c, we walked 2km to the outer ferry station to catch the hourly ferry to Ilha de Tavira. We had plenty of time to make the 11 o&#39;clock ferry, but we decided to check out the market on the way and cut it a little close. We had to cover the last 1100 metres in exactly 11 minutes or wait an hour for the next ferry. We just made it, we walked on just as the pilot cast off from the dock. All it took was, as Cindy calls it, walking with purpose. I tied my loose shoelace on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach at Tavira was excellent, but completely different than the high cliffs and heavy surf of the west coast. Ilha de Tavira is a big sand dune, 11km long and up to 1km wide, with a long, uninterrupted sandy beach on the ocean side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked and walked along the beach, but there wasn&#39;t really that much variation, so we headed back to the section near the ferry station and sacked out on a pair of lounge chairs. We were just about finished the lunch we had packed when a man came by and told us the chairs required payment. Who knew? We apologized, blamed our Canadian-ness and left in a hurry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we heard a band playing off in the distance and saw a crowd gathering, so we wandered over to see what was going on. We got caught up in the first Easter procession of the season in Tavira - bands, town officials, church groups, Boy and Girl Scouts and two large floats went throughout the town, stopping at several stations along the way to the Cathedral. The stations were really interesting because they were permanently set up. The doors were opened just for the procession, but they are there on the street the rest of the year. But if you weren&#39;t from the town, you&#39;d have no idea what was behind the wooden doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tavira is a wonderful little town and I highly recommend visiting, especially if you want to relax for a few days. It was the perfect way to end the Portuguese leg of our Great Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tavira, we got on a bus for the Spanish border and the delights of Andalusia. But we really, really loved Portugal. Great sites, great food and wonderful, friendly people, from the hustle and bustle of Lisbon to the tiniest villages of Monchique and Odeceixe. We loved every minute in this beautiful country and can&#39;t wait to visit again. There&#39;s so much more to see. We could&#39;ve stayed longer in Lisbon. We never made it to Sintra, or even Setubol and Troia. Not to mention the northern cities of Porto and Coimbra, or the ruins at Conimbriga, or the Duoro valley. There&#39;s another long trip in there, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a wondeful evening in Odeceixe, we slept very well and slowly got packed up to continue our trip down the west coast of Portugal. It was Saturday morning, so we figured there must be some pastelarias open even in a village as tiny as this. I was very pleasantly surprised to see a Paderia (bread bakery) sign on a side street, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Bread bakery down a narrow side street&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to check every side street. Magic awaits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the bakery was very small but the shelves were full of bread, buns and croissants. I had my morning coffee and pastry and tried, in my best Portuguese, to explain that I was a baker and their bread looked very good. I made some sense, because the clerk called over the owner (who spoke very good english) and she invited us next door to the bakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner&#39;s mother, a delightful elderly lady who only spoke Portuguese gave us a tour of the shop. Two huge mixers, a big work bench, and a massive deck oven. The bakery was spotless; the bakers came in at 8pm Friday night to do the baking so by 10am Saturday, all the work was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she surprised the heck out of me. She took us around the side of the oven and showed me a room with wood stacked floor to ceiling. The deck oven was wood fired! There was a small firebox beside the deck oven which held the fire. I don&#39;t really know how she regulated the heat, but I think the fire heats a boiler and the oven is heated by circulating hot water (you can buy gas fired &#39;steam tube&#39; ovens in North America.) Still, I don&#39;t know how they could adjust things in a wood fired oven that large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we were back on the road, heading south along the coast to Arrifana. It&#39;s an area that came highly recommended by the lady at the Faro tourist office and it did not disappoint in any way. We parked high up on the top of a cliff, far too scared to drive down to the beach, then walked along the top, through a small village, to a point overlooking the Atlantic. Sheer cliffs and broken rocks were all around us, with the surf pounding the rocks below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looked dangerous and it was. We saw a steady stream of locals walking and driving north to the edge of the cliff. When we looked out past them, we saw a rescue helicopter and two boats alongside some particularly nasty looking rocks. We couldn&#39;t make out their objective, but the helicopter flew so low, and hovered for so long, that I&#39;m certain they were performing a rescue. After 20 minutes or so the helicopter left and the locals went home. I hope whoever they were helping are alright today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went down to the beach, along a narrow, twisting road with three switchbacks and a steady line of camper vans and surfer dudes. Arrifana is a surfing hotspot it seems. There were surf lessons going on at one end of the beach, and a stream of fit and sexy surfers along the rest of the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t surf, but we did walk along the beach, wade into the water and marvel at the cliffs around us. This beach especially was extremely shallow close to shore, so we could walk out a long way without getting to wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an leg burning hike back to our car, we drove for an hour further down the coast to the very tip of Portugal and the European continent, Cabo St. Vincente. It&#39;s the western most point in Europe, and if I looked really, really hard in the west I&#39;m sure I could see New Jersey. Perhaps not. But we scrambled over the rocks as close to the edge as we dared (we were still very high up above the water) watched the fishermen bobbing violently in their boats near the cliff walls, had a nice conversation with two travellers from Minnesota, then headed east, back into Portugal, to another beach we had passed on the drive to the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not exactly sure of the name of our final beach of the day, but it was just east of Cabo St. Vincente. It didn&#39;t seem possible, but the water was clearer, the surf was livlier, and the cliffs more spectacular than any of the beaches we had been to so far. Perhaps it was because the hike down was steeper and more treacherous than any other; no cobblestones here, just irregular steps with many of the rocks broken away. Or maybe it was because there were no more than a dozen people on the entire beach. But it was thrilling, and we dawdled along for over an hour here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end of the beach, were the sand, surf and rocks met, there was a little cave that we could just get to without swimming. It opened into a huge cavern, open to the sky above. We imagined that this is where we could hang out if we were abandoned on a desert island. We&#39;d survive in the cave, until the tide came in at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it was one more hike back to the car and a final push along the highway. Through Sagres, Lagos and Portimao, stopping beside the highway for another bag of oranges. East past Faro and Olhao, and on to our final stop in Portugal, Tavira. Here the guidebooks, Cindy&#39;s research and the Faro tourist office lady all agreed - Tavira is a delightful place to finish a tour of the Algarve. But that&#39;s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Temporary Photo Fix</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello from Spain.  The last two posts have been missing pictures.  I hesitate to blame technology (heck, 12 years ago you&#39;d all be waiting for me to come back and process the films) but I&#39;m blaming the technology.  It&#39;s gotten too good for the type of posting I&#39;m trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-picture-plan&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Picture Plan &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, here&#39;s how the blog will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll post stories about the trip.  Some long, some short little snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also bulk upload a selection of pictures to a special gallery in my SmugMug photo sharing account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll link to the gallery at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures in the gallery will be roughly sorted into the same order which I talk about things in the post.  But they won&#39;t likely have a caption per picture.  Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s two galleries to get you caught up with the last two posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallery for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Evora-Post/&quot;&gt;Evora: Step Back.  Step Way Back.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallery for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Algarve-post-1&quot;&gt;The Algarve Has Been Logged.   You Must Visit Anyway.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-details-for-those-who-care-about-this-sort-of-thing&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Technical Details For Those Who Care About This Sort Of Thing &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some detail for the geeks in the audience.  I won&#39;t feel bad if you stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is built on a self hosted Wordpress site.  I&#39;m writing my posts on a new iPad and posting whenever I have access to Wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the official Wordpress iPad app to post.  I&#39;ve tried posting straight from the Safari browser too and still get the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as I see it, is that the image files from my new iPhone and Cindy&#39;s new camera are just too big to upload to my self hosted site.  Whether I upload the images from the Wordpress app or the Safari browser, and whether a bulk &#39;add media&#39; operation or from the post editor, the upload hangs up before it is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can upload the files to SmugMug with no problem.  OK, it takes forever, but it works so long as I leave the iPad alone for an hour per post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I resize the images and reduce the file size, it works.  But there&#39;s no automatic resize capability with Apple Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 3rd party app to do the resize, and it works, but individually resizing each photo, then getting back to the Wordpress app, finding the space in the post, loading and embedding the picture, etc. Is just taking too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent over 5 hours on my Estremoz post alone and we were almost in Spain before I had time to finish it and post it.  At this rate I&#39;ll be home and Christmas will come and I&#39;ll still be posting about the trip.  Cindy and I want to see new things rather than sit around uploading photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get home, I can quickly resize the photos on my PC, or just upload them to Wordpress from my computer/proper internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other change I could make is to see if my server has a file size restriction that I don&#39;t know about, which may be causing the issue.  Ie, don&#39;t allow uploads of more than 2mb from Europe.  But that&#39;s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smugmug solution doesn&#39;t give an awesome reading experience.  Having the pictures in the right place in the post is better.  But at least this way I can stay more current and people can see pictures too.  I know Cindy&#39;s mom wants to see more pics.  So that&#39;s one person anyway, and a pretty important person at that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Algarve Has Been Logged.  You Must Visit Anyway.</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-algarve-has-been-logged-you-must-visit-anyway/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-algarve-has-been-logged-you-must-visit-anyway/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Embedding photos is still a bear with my iPad.  But if you want to follow along, &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Algarve-post-1&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a photo gallery covering the areas we went to in this post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our tour of dolmans and megaliths was over, Libanio dropped us off near our apartment. We ran upstairs, grabbed our bags and walked (&amp;quot;with purpose&amp;quot; as Cindy says) down the alley,through the city gate, down the road to the bus depot and straight on the bus to Faro. Five minutes early, I might add!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faro is the capital of the Algarve region of Portugal. It&#39;s the most southern strip of the country, bordering Alentejo on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, Spain on the east and the Mediterranean Sea on the south. You might say it&#39;s the Tourist Area - pretty much all my Canadian friends who tell me of their winter escapes to Portugal go to the Algarve for the beaches, golf and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we could see the beach, we had to go through the mountains on the northern border of the Algarve. While not tall be Rocky Mountain standards, they were a big change from the rolling hills of Alentejo. While we travelled on the main north/south highway, we traveled straight through, but as we exited for the various bus stops on the way the roads twisted and turned quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, our first impression of Faro was poor. But we were on the bus, travelling too fast past hotels, shopping malls and outlet stores. And of course the bus depot was in a seedier area of town. But as we walked to our guest room for the next two nights, the streets opened up and it was really quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying in the &amp;quot;old city&amp;quot; which dates back to the 13th century and was full of our favourite narrow cobblestone streets. And just outside the city walls were 6-8 twisty blocks of pedestrian only streets full of shops, pastelarias, gelaterias and restaurants. Plus, being on the Mediterranian coast, Faro had a harbour, with a long promenade that we walked at least six times, to and from our room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the weather was sunny and mild for us, around 18C, you could tell it gets hot in the summer, since all the streets had white sailcloth stretched between the buildings, providing shade for the shoppers. So we walked around the shopping district, then over to the public garden (with more of my coffee kiosks!) and to the local library. We spent an hour browsing the stacks, looking for books we recognized, even if we couldn&#39;t read them since they were all in Portuguese. Although I did browse through an interesting history of Portuguese postage stamps and learned stamps were called &amp;quot;selo&amp;quot;, which really would&#39;ve helped at the post office in Evora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we were at a crossroads. Before we left home, we planned on traveling to the Atlantic side of the Algarve, but the bus schedules were against us. Many of the areas we wanted to visit are hard to get to in the height of summer, and are pretty much impossible to reach in low season. One bus in at 9AM, one out at 9PM, etc. We&#39;d be spending all our time and money on bus rides and not see anything. So we decided to break our pre-trip promise and rent a car. We found a place near the airport which rented cars with automatic transmissions (they had exactly one in stock) and after promising with our lives that we wouldn&#39;t damage it further (it was already missing one light and had dents in all four corners and all four sides) we were on the highway to Monchique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief word about European cars. I love them. We were driving a Citroen, and though I really wanted a tiny Fiat, or a jazzy Renault even, the Citroen was fine. But their automatic transmissions are really strange. I think they just took a manual and slapped a robot shifter on it. There&#39;s no &amp;quot;Park&amp;quot; so the car will still roll on you and shifting through the first three gears was as rough as if I were shifting myself. Plus there&#39;s &#39;eco&#39; mode, where the engine shuts off at stops and restarts when you release the brake. I thought it was stalling for the longest time. I will learn to drive a manual next trip, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the taxis to the airport, rental contract stress and &#39;Eco&#39; mode, I was getting rather agitated. Hungry too, because we did all this before breakfast. So we decided to stop in the town of Sao Bras de Alportel for a bite. One wrong turn had me trying to park on the narrowest street in town but we survived and were fed. From this point we parked at the first blue &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; sign on the outskirts of each town in which we stopped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tummies full, we headed west toward Silves.  This off the beaten track town is renowned for its castle which was built, modified and rebuilt by both the Moors and Christians.  While the exterior of the castle is intact and old, the &amp;quot;rooftop&amp;quot; interior has been added to recently, with a rather smart walking path, garden and restaurant.  Plus, there&#39;s a nice exhibit on the plight of the Iberian Lynx in a massive indoor chamber, which was originally a water cistern in Moorish times.  Boy, even the water cisterns are amazing to behold!  We spent an hour or so roaming around the castle, ate lunch on a bench admiring the castle walls and palm trees, then hiked back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final destination the first day was Monchique, a tiny village deep in the Algarve hills. The drive to Monchique was superb. Clean, smooth pavement, no traffic at all, my lovely navigator beside me helping negotiate roundabouts and all around us, blue skies, high hills, deep valleys and tiny villages with their white houses and red roofs clustered in pockets on the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kind grandma selling her oranges beside the highway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound are way through the central Algarve for over an hour until we got to Monchique, hastily parked the car and found a room for the night. We stayed in a nice room at a B&amp;amp;B right beside the tourist office, staffed by a tiny old lady who was so small she couldn&#39;t reach the board on the wall to get our room key. All she wanted was 40 euros cash and assurance that we&#39;d leave the keys at the desk. Oh, and we needed to understand there would be no breakfast tomorrow. I think we were the only guests that night and it was too much bother to make breakfast for one. That was no problem, because Monchique has a lovely square at the very bottom of the hill town which just begged to be occupied in the early morning sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were up early, checked out and put our bags in the car. But then we left the village on foot; we had a mountain to climb. Monchique is near the Foia, the highest point of land in Portugal. At 902 metres, it isn&#39;t anywhere near the tallest mountain in Europe, but it was the tallest here and within our grasp. So we wound our way through the village, past the convent and started on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4km walk was tougher than I expected. I guess my climbing legs didn&#39;t stick with me once we left Lisbon, plus the trail was very rough. Lots of loose rocks and quite large rocks at that. It also didn&#39;t help that there weren&#39;t many trees after the first kilometre or so. We had great views of the surrounding hills and saw that there weren&#39;t many trees there either. The entire surrounding hillside had been clear cut, including a large section of the trail. We walked through churned up land, logs and stumps. Where new trees had been planted, and only a very small area had been replanted, the native trees were replaced with tall, straight and foreign Eucalyptus trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Evora, Libanio told us many landowners are growing Eucalypts for pulp and paper production, since they grow so fast. But they need a lot of water and don&#39;t add to the undergrowth in the forest. So what you get is trees growing on what looks like rough gravel, with no foliage underneath. And where there were no Eucalypts, entire hillsides were bare or covered with a tight, dense, green blanket of waist high thorn bushes. It was a much different walk in the woods than we were used to at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we kept walking and gingerly picked our way up the trail, and it wasn&#39;t too long before we reached a paved road up to the summit. The road was paved because the summit of Foia is used for cell towers. There&#39;s a little village of maintenance huts and towers at the very top. But the views all around the summit were amazing. Hills and valleys and villages and fields surrounded and on a clear blue morning we could see for miles. We had bagged our first peak. We&#39;ll be sure to do this again in the Netherlands. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got back to the car, we took off north and west, along twistier roads than the day before, over and out of the Algarve hills and out to the Atlantic coast. The roads were amazing. So twisty that I could only drive 50-60 km/h but I was the only car on the road. So we took it easy and cruised to the west coast. Before long we left the hills and got back to straighter roads and farmland. Then, cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southwest coast of Portugal is known for its high cliff sides and crashing surf, dotted with gorgeous sandy beaches. There were dozens of beaches along the coast, too many to see them all, but we went to three on the west side - Zambujero do Mar, Odeceixe and Arrifana. Zambujero do Mar was the furthest north, so we drove there first. It was stunning. A tiny resort village with buildings right up to the edge of the cliff, then, far below, a U shaped beach of smooth brown sand and amazing blue water. There were two or three tiny cafes at the edge of the cliff with incredible views so, of course, we picked the prettiest one for lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an amazing lunch, we were sad to learn that access to the beach was blocked. Construction crews were rebuilding the cobblestone road and sidewalk leading down to the beach, so the beach was closed. It was so frustrating to see all that beauty and not be able to get a closer view. But we were very close to our goal for the day, so we got back to the car and drove down the coast to Odeceixe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odeceixe (pronounced O-da-saysh) was the real reason we rented the car. Long before we left home, Cindy read about this tiny village on the west coast border between Alentejo and the Algarve and wanted to go. She asked everyone we met about Odeceixe and they all agreed it was beautiful. So how could we miss it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village is 3km from the coast, along a river that flows out to the ocean. We stopped in the village, found a room for the night (I think it was the first time the room was used this year) then drove down to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our guidebooks talked about walking along the river to the beach (the hike was what caught Cindy&#39;s imagination) we drove rather than walked because, well, we&#39;d already climbed a mountain in the morning. It was a good call, because there wasn&#39;t really a trail along the river anyway. We would&#39;ve just been walking on the roadside and it required a lot of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach at Odeceixe was splendid in every way. Restaurants, cafes and beach houses at the top of the cliff, a glorious clean, pristine beach down below, crashing surf and great light since it was almost sunset. This beach had the added bonus of a second freshwater beach where the river emptied into the ocean. We walked all over the ocean side, then followed the river upstream for a bit, waved hello to the fishermen on the opposite river bank and generally smiled a lot. It was a beautiful sunset in a gorgeous setting. We drove back to the village, ate a pizza and drank too much wine at a cafe in the village square, I sampled some of the local hooch (a liquor I can&#39;t pronounce mixed with honey - delicious) and we staggered back to our room and fell asleep instantly. What a full day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Evora:  Step Back.  Way Back.</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi.  I&#39;ve been having a terrible time this week getting photos up to the website.  First Cindy had a problem with her camera (fixed) then I can&#39;t seem to get strong enough WIFI for the pictures to upload.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than wait, and forget where I was or what I was doing, I&#39;m going to post some updates picture free.  Then when I get pictures loaded, I&#39;ll post a photo gallery or something.  Sorry about that!  Mark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: let&#39;s try this.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Evora-Post&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a link to a photo gallery of our Evora pictures.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, here&#39;s what happened in Evora...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the skies cleared from the afternoon rain shower, we left Estremoz and headed back to Evora. Evora is the capital of the Alentejo region and is a sight to behold when you come in the late afternoon, from the northeast, and gaze upon the hill and the cluster of white walled houses gleaming in the sun. Then you pass under a massive aqueduct that trails off into the countryside, ride alongside the tall city walls and finally pass through the walls, on foot, to your flat in the inner city. It&#39;s romantic as all get out. Cindy and I bounced along the Main Street into the city, then through a maze of progressively narrower alleyways until we met Maria, our Airbnb host, and got the keys to our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to our cramped top floor flat in Lisbon, Maria&#39;s apartment was massive. We entered into a large living/dining room with our bedroom off the side. To our right was a massive kitchen with stone floors and an ancient chimney over the stove, a large marble sink and a 10 foot ceiling. Maria works in a restaurant and clearly loves food because the kitchen was laid out for serious cooking. The bathroom was through the kitchen at the back of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only challenge with Maria&#39;s apartment was that, like Evora outside, and Alentejo in general, it was COLD! The region is designed for the long, hot, dry summers and the buildings are designed to stay cool. Portuguese people just bundle up and get through winter, I guess. So there&#39;s no central heating and no way to really get the house warm. So we wore our outdoor clothes inside again and dreamed of buying sweaters and slippers once the shops opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way Maria&#39;s tiny portable heater was going to subdue her large apartment, so we closed the door to the kitchen, sacrificing it and the bathroom to the cold. We propped the heater between the living room and bedroom and let &#39;er rip. With the help of a few blanket/shawls we were fine. So long as we remembered to put on shoes when heading to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evora is very old. That is to say, there&#39;s been a city on this hill for a very long time. It was a major centre in Roman times. There are ruins of a temple at one of the high points of the city, and the remains of a Roman bath under City Hall. But the current city was built on top of the Roman plan in the 1500s AD. That&#39;s right, what we&#39;re looking at and walking around is &#39;only&#39; 500 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evora has an intact set of city walls, so the population of 40,000 either lives &amp;quot;inside the walls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;outside the walls.&amp;quot; Although with everyone living on compact streets and in tiny apartments, I suspect a great majority of people still live inside the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Evora is built on a hill, with all roads leading to the central square, it helps to imagine the city like a clock. The square is in the centre of the dial, but stretches across the face towards 9 o&#39;clock and 3 o&#39;clock. The Roman era Temple of Diana is still in the middle, but towards 9 o&#39;clock. The Cathedral is just to the left of centre, and the wide &amp;quot;central&amp;quot; square is more to the right, toward 3 o&#39;clock. With me? Then let&#39;s take a tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came into Evora from the bus depot, outside the city walls, right at the bottom (6 o&#39;clock.) Our apartment was right near the entry to the walled city, but let&#39;s say at 7 o&#39;clock. But our first adventure was a further away, right at 9 o&#39;clock beside the temple of Diana. That&#39;s where we found the aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing cities need lots of clean, drinkable water to feed its population. And in hot, dry Alentejo, the lack of drinking water was really holding Evora back. So the Romans built an aqueduct to carry water from the river in the hills 15km outside town. That is to say, they built a 15km long gravity fed stone water trough that steadily and consistently flows down from springs in the distant hills to the end point high up in the hill city of Evora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Rome, the aqueduct fell into disrepair, but was rebuilt in the 1500&#39;s and again in the 1800&#39;s. It still looks ancient and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the endpoint of the aqueduct near the ruins of the Temple of Diana. Even though at some points the structure towers 30 feet overhead, the endpoint is a small building no more than 6 feet above ground. But from there the structure extends along the street, outside town, then turns left and runs past a convent and into the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the land rises and falls, the aqueduct must maintain a steady slope, dropping at most 10m every kilometre. So at times, the structure is quite low to the ground, or even goes underground in places. But when the land falls away, the aqueduct is the largest thing in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed its path along the road, around the convent, and through farmer&#39;s fields for 4 kilometres until we&#39;d had enough. The sun was setting soon and we were a good distance out of town, so we found a road that would loop back to the 6 o&#39;clock gate into the walled city and followed it home. We climbed quite a bit into the hills while following the aqueduct, so the downhill stroll home was a nice treat. It was an idyllic evening, cool and clear. We even had to stop for a herd of cows to cross the road to get back to the barn. 60 cows and calves with a single farmer following behind and calling instructions to the herd. How lovely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we spent a lot of time walking and exploring the side streets off the main square. We saw the temple of Diana and walked up to the massive Cathedral, then down to the University of Evora (2 o&#39;clock), which dates to the 1700&#39;s and is right at the edge of the city walls. We found a very cute pastelaria near the University that was so good we tried to go again the next day, and got wonderfully lost before giving up. Then we turned the corner and there is was. Many of the pastry shops get all their products from the same bakeries, but our favourite was different. The lady behind the counter was the same lady who did all the baking and was in the dozens of pictures on the wall, each time posing with a local celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around from the University toward the southeast corner of the city (4 o&#39;clock) is a wonderful, large public garden. When the cities are full of buildings and cobblestones and cathedrals and ruins, it&#39;s nice to have a green space. In the afternoons especially, the park was full of kids playing and people just hanging out at one of the several bar kiosks throughout the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word now for these amazing green beacons of joy. Throughout Portugal, in parks, plazas and public squares, you will find a tiny green kiosk with small tables and red chairs in front. These tiny oases are fully stocked - ice cream, candy, water, espresso, wine, beer and a fully stocked bar. Some even have newspapers and magazines and lotto tickets. Often they even have a TV on in the corner showing a soccer game. What an immensely civilized structure! I have yet to pass one without smiling and I can&#39;t pass three without stopping for an espresso. Why are there not 7 of these spaced around Wascana Lake?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our final morning in Evora, Cindy arranged a special treat. She contacted a retired University professor named Libanio Merteira Reis to take us on a tour of some sites around Evora that were very old indeed. Much, much older than the Romans. Before the dawn of recorded history, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archeologists have found evidence of settlements on the Iberian Peninsula from the Neolithic age. That is, from the time of the very first humans, over 30,000 years ago. And the area around Evora contains some of the best discoveries on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some context setting at a local museum, we took off into the country in Libanio&#39;s Volvo. Our first stop was a cave near Escaurol. In 1963, some quarrymen blasted a hillside to loosen it up a little and found a cave entrance. Inside the entrance were human bones. Archeologists took a look at the remains and the cave beyond and realized that the bones were, in the whole scheme of things, rather recent additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the miners had really created was a new &#39;back door&#39; into a sanctuary where it is believed that early humans have gathered for tens of thousands of years. But they would have entered through a long, narrow tunnel that opened up into this larger sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tours to the Escaurol caves are tightly controlled. Only around 1000 people are allowed in each year, so we felt very fortunate to be allowed inside. In the sanctuary are faint paintings and etchings in the rock wall. Horses heads, pregnant cattle and other symbols. They are very tough to see and many are covered over in places due to calcification on the cave wall. But still, we&#39;re talking the very, very beginning of human civilization. These markings are from a time when humans first started to settle in one place; to move from being hunter-gathers to forming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we left the cave and continued our drive through the beautiful Alentejo countryside, Libanio told us that these caves were used as burial chambers for the mightiest members of the group. And when a cave wasn&#39;t available, the community would build a structure called a &#39;dolman&#39; to replicate a cave. We were off to see a very large dolman now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m sure you know about the pyramids in Egypt, right? Massive burial chambers, really. So now imagine a very similar things being built, several thousand years earlier, in what is now Spain and Portugal. Huge stone slabs cut from local hills, hauled and stacked to form a round structure with an opening facing the sunrise. A hallway extending the opening, built of smaller stones. Then cap stones over the whole thing. And then, the entire structure being buried to create an artificial hill, with an artificial cave inside. That&#39;s a dolman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, the soil around the dolman eroded, exposing the stones. We were able to climb up the back side and see inside (the cap stone was dragged off and broken by an early archeologist many years ago.) Each of the side stones was truly huge - at least 12-15 feet above ground. Now, 10,000 years later, it looks like a pile or rocks, until you realize that people had to cut them with only Copper Age tools and haul them without the invention of a wheel. Remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final destination on the tour was a Really Big Deal. The Megaliths - a group of 90 standing stones set in an oval pattern to denote the changing of the seasons. Similar in purpose to the other standing stone sites like Stonehenge, but 3,000 years older than their more famous English cousin. And with several of the stones having engravings and symbols on them that are still visible if the light is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s the thing. You can walk right up to them. Walk around them. Contemplate them. Think of what they mean and how the site was used. I hear there&#39;s a big rope around Stonehenge so you can&#39;t get close, but we could take a rubbing on the stones if we wanted to (we didn&#39;t!). With the exception of the Escaurol caves, all these sites were free, open and fully accessible. Fun and scary at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private tour with Libanio was our first &#39;big ticket&#39; item of our trip but it was oh so worth it. Libanio helped us put our visit to Evora into real context. Yes, we were tracing the steps of the Romans and the Renaissance Portuguese, but in Evora we were also retracing the steps of some of the very earliest human settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really got me thinking about my life in Regina. I mean, we tell people that Regina is just over 100 years old. And yes, there were the First Nations people before that. But I remember a visit I took to the petroglyphs near Willow Bunch when I was a kid. I need to get back there soon and reconnect to the first peoples of North America too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what I was thinking after Libanio dropped us off in Evora mere minutes before our bus out of town. We were leaving Alentejo and heading south, into the Algarve. But that&#39;s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Estremoz:  To Market, To Market</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/estremoz-to-market-to-market/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-10T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although there was much more to see around Lisbon, it was Friday so it was time to move on.  We found our way along the metro to the bus station and booked our tickets to Estremoz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estremoz is a very small town in the Alentejo region of Portugal, that is, the south central region of Portugal that borders Spain to the east and the Algarve to the south.  &amp;quot;Alentejo&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;beyond&amp;quot; and refers to the area beyond Lisbon and the Tagus river.  It is an extremely beautiful area, especially for a Saskatchewan boy who has been dealing with the crowds of Lisbon.  Rolling hills, fields surrounded by stone walls, farmhouses with white walls and courtyards and grassland dotted with cork trees.  Open space but with lots to gaze upon too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t get the history of it, but Estremoz must have lots and lots of marble nearby.  The entire town is beautiful, pink marble.  The cobblestone sidewalks are small pieces of pink marble.  The curbs are small slabs of marble.  Heck, the bus station is all marble!  Harbour Landing homeowners would be seeing kitchen countertops at every intersection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estremoz is a compact town on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding farmland.  And what does one put on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding territory?  A castle, of course!  Estremoz castle isn&#39;t as big as Castelo Palmela, but it&#39;s got all one needs; narrow, winding streets weaving their way up to the castle, walls surrounding the castle and church with a nice walking path around most of the hill, and a gorgeous set of steps down to the town centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the castle and church has been turned into a &lt;em&gt;pousada&lt;/em&gt;, a state run hotel and restaurant complex for people much wealthier than I.  Many of the castles and churches in the country have been converted to pousadas in order to fund their upkeep.  It&#39;s certainly a different way to see the country than our Airbnb apartments and guest houses.  I don&#39;t begrudge the wealthy their comforts, because the pousadas were nice to look at on our way to the town square and our modest room for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We booked a room at the Hotel O Gahdana, a two star hotel just off the main square which was recommended in Cindy&#39;s guide book.  At 40€ for the night it was a tiny splurge but was well worth it.  It was a mansion compared to our tiny flat in Lisbon; wide hallway, spacious room and a shower that let me stand upright.  And the staff were amazing.  Only the night supervisor spoke any English, but we listened hard, played a bit of charades and worked everything out with the day crew.&lt;/p&gt;

Wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got to play charades at the tiny restaurant down the street where we went for supper.  We held out till 7:30PM but were still the first customers of the night, although the five other tables filled up soon after.  We did our best to navigate the Portuguese menu; Cindy knew she was getting fish and I knew I ordered pork, but beyond that we had no idea.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Both plates were huge and delicious.  Two big plates, plus bread and wine, plus the desert of the house (which was delicious) for under 25€.  Incredible.   I&#39;m pretty sure a 1/2 litre of local wine was 3€, which is so cheap I wish I could handle a litre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the real reason we came to Estremoz wasn&#39;t for the castle, or the wine.  It was for the market!  Each Saturday, Estremoz is home to one of the largest farmer&#39;s markets in all of Portugal.  Cindy set an alarm for this one.  We weren&#39;t going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to remember, early March is still late winter in Portugal.  There&#39;s not much on offer, or so they told us.  But I&#39;ll tell you what, there was more selection at the Estremoz market than most Regina farmers markets.  Huge bins of oranges, lemons, potatoes, carrots, almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts. Strawberries!  Peppers! Winter squash so big that they sold them buy the chunk.  One fellow even had a basket of huge avocados from his two trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were baskets of eggs that you could pick out and put in the carton yourself.  Some grandmas just sat on a bench with a basket of eggs to sell.  They didn&#39;t even need a stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of it was live!  There was a row of sellers with chickens, ducks, geese and rabbits in cages.  We learned this is prime rabbit season and were a little scared of one old gentleman who gave his rabbit a good looking over before agreeing to take him home.  I thought he was going to ring its neck right then and there. Over the course of the morning dozens of people took their Sunday dinner home in a cardboard box with airholes cut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway through the morning, we got another treat. There was an off-road racing event just out of town, so all the trucks in the event held a parade through town.  Three laps of honour around the square.  I thought it was an incredible racket, but lots of the old fellows stopped to have a look.  (In the afternoon, there was a second parade of muddy trucks, but not near as many people stayed to see that one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered our new favourite market snack.  It&#39;s called Fartura and is the Portuguese version of a churro, or beaver tail, or elephant ear.  Fried dough in sugar.  What could be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two Fartura stands.  One run by an old couple (Sir fried the dough while Madam mixed the batter, portioned out the Fartura and took the money.) This booth had a line all day long.  We waited 10 minutes and we were lucky.  The other stand was run by a young man and I never saw a single person go to that stand.  There&#39;s an interesting story there but my Portuguese isn&#39;t strong enough to get the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique trick to Fartura is the batter is squeezed out in a continuous, circular spiral, flipped as a single unit, then cut (by madam) into long sticks and then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Two sticks made up one portion and most people bought two or three portions to take home. We tucked into ours before we had even left the line. Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much more to the market.  One seller specialized in pet birds, from tiny chickadees to peacocks.  There were many plant growers selling bedding plants (they&#39;d pull 20 plugs of lettuce or carrot or tomato seedlings, put them all in a plastic bag and sell them for 1€) and fruit trees.  I would&#39;ve bought an orange tree for 7.50€ but it wouldn&#39;t fit in my suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, beside the farmer&#39;s market was a flea market; row after row of antiques, used books, pottery and clothes.  There was even a man selling a table full of Russian cameras and Soviet military hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;a flea market stall of colourfully painted ceramic bowls.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my favourite sellers, bar none, were the three young girls selling cake by the slice.  They had baked three cakes at home and had them displayed on a wooden table.  For 1€, you got a slice of the cake of your choice, cut to order and wrapped in a napkin.  The Regina health inspector would pass a large stone at the thought, but I&#39;ll tell you what, we put the paper wrapped cake in Cindy&#39;s pack and ate it a day or so later.  I&#39;m still able to write about it and never even got the shakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By around 12:30 it had started to rain, so all the sellers packed up and headed to the bars, pastelarias and snack bars around the square for a drink and bite to eat.  We ducked into a pastelaria too, for coffee, hot chocolate, a pastry and a box of cookies for the afternoon bus to Evora.  It&#39;s only a one hour ride, but you can never be too prepared.  Emergency cookies are an important component of every traveler&#39;s kit.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-magical-meeting-in-palmela/&quot;&gt;In our last episode&lt;/a&gt;, our intrepid travellers embarked on an adventure full of distant train stations, steep switchbacks, and chance meetings with intensely interesting people.  But it was time to hit &amp;quot;post&amp;quot; and they were still on top of Castelo Palmela, trying to determine their next move.  Will they make it down in one piece?  Will Cindy ever see Setubol?  Will Mark get his mid-afternoon espresso?  Read on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was getting toward 6pm and our amazing day in Palmela had to end. We were tired, footsore and hungry. Reluctantly, we made for the train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we were also feeling extra happy and brave, so we decided to take the gravel short cut back to the train station. Remember, it was on the map app, and we could see the path clear as day. So off we went, hand in hand. We were walking through the Portuguese countryside, just as we had dreamed, and if it was only for a few kilometres between towns that was just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Our path below&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes up must go down, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got a little interesting though, when the map showed a fork in the road and we couldn&#39;t see the fork. Oh there it is - our route was no longer a road, but a walking path. Then a little further, it got smaller still, to a single bike track. Then the barbed wire fences and the &#39;Private Property&#39; signs. (At least I think that&#39;s what they said, they were in Portuguese.) Soon, the muddy descent on a now washed out path. But the path is on an app! It has to be real! As we descended the hill, the fences kept narrowing towards us on the left and right. We were being funnelled to a point, but couldn&#39;t tell if there was a break in the fence at the point.  Just when I figured I&#39;d have to boost Cindy over some barbed wire, there was a break in the fence so we didn&#39;t have to wreck our new travel clothes. At least not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Mark on a very narrow path&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we were near some houses again. Gated estates, actually. With high walls and lots of noisy dogs, enraged at the intrusion on their domain by two tasty looking Canadians who straggled down the back of their property. Luckily, the path (which had now widened to a trail again) led between two of these estates and we nervously stumbled back onto the highway. Right near a McDonalds no less. We were in Aires again, and limped the final 2 km to the station relieved that we actually knew where we were going. No more map apps tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

I looked easier from the top!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled on the train and headed back to Lisbon.  I was so tired.  I tried to watch the three young folks play cards beside us but could never figure out their game, and besides, I kept nodding off in the middle of the hand.  But I was also very, very hungry.  We resolved to find a place to eat between our metro station and the big hill right before our flat, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting looking side alley just before the big hill that Cindy had wanted to check out all week, so this time we went down.  It quickly forked into two even smaller allies, with three restaurants all in a row (left side, middle point and right side.) Left side was too fancy; white tablecloths and black aprons.  The middle point looked really good, but only had empty tables outside, and we were too cold to eat outdoors tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right side was different.  Colourful.  Lively music you could hear from the street.  Tables mostly full, but room indoors.  Menu on a chalkboard.  We figured why not and went inside. Called Tas&#39;Ka, it looked like a coffee bar or lunch counter that had been repurposed to be  a restaurant.  But it sure smelled good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They serve African food that is representative of the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique.  It had only been open for a week and all the food was created and cooked by a lady we could watch from our seats. She was legit; cooking Real African Food,  just like mom and grandma.  At least according to Anna Dika, the lady seated beside us, who is without a doubt the biggest fan of Tas&#39;Ka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of or meal, Anna helped us order and checked in on every course to make sure we liked it (we did.)  She was appalled that we were drinking water, so got us two glasses of wine so we could taste the food properly.  When we didn&#39;t order one of her favourite dishes, she made sure our waiter brought some by to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn&#39;t enough, it turned out that tonight was our waiter Clarence&#39;s birthday.  Anna and six or seven other people were at the restaurant to make sure Clarence was celebrating properly.  Cake was served.  Shots were poured.  Songs were sung, including Portuguese Happy Birthday, which we were lucky enough to know already (we learned the Brazilian version and it was close enough.) So we made two new friends and had cake too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our bellys were completely full, and Anna had filled my notebook with places to eat in Alentejo (our next destination), we were allowed to leave Tas&#39;Ka.  We got back to our flat and were fast asleep in under 10 minutes, I&#39;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a day! Other than seeing the castle in Palmela, we didn&#39;t do a single thing we had planned.  But we had a month&#39;s worth of adventures in a single day. That&#39;s what travel is all about - I just never thought it would happen to me.  But I really hoped it would.  I&#39;m a lucky guy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Magical Meeting In Palmela</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cindy rousted me out of bed by 9:30 because we had a big day ahead of us. We were going to take our first train across the river and out of Lisbon. Just a short trip today. 40 minutes to Palmela and then 5 minutes further to Setubol. Palmela is known for its Medieval castle with amazing views so we definitely wanted to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ticket process was a little confusing, but we had 20 minutes to figure it out before the train left. And we nailed it in 10. Every station has an information booth, but we&#39;ve yet to see a booth with a person in it. Beside the booth is a kiosk with a few English words and far too many options. But there&#39;s often a helpful passenger to guide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling around the greater Lisbon area is actually really easy and very cheap.  There are lots of buses, four metro (subway) lines and the light rail trains to places like Sintra and Setubol.  And all work with a single &amp;quot;Viva Viagem&amp;quot; card.  You buy the card for 0.50€ and then load it up with money at kiosks around every station.  For the metro, you scan the card when you enter the station and again when you leave; the fee for the ride is then deducted from your card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;The extremely useful Via Viagem card&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extremely useful Via Viagem card&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge with trains is that you buy a specific fare at the kiosk, and you can&#39;t buy the fare if there are insufficient funds on the card.  So load the card, then buy the ticket.  But what if you don&#39;t know the fare?  You go in circles, endlessly looping around the kiosk menu, until the person behind you in line takes pity and tells you the fare.  4.15€ to Palmela.  And you can only by a one way ticket.  You can go through all this again at the Palmela station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Palmela was hilarious, just like our trip to Belem. We looked out the window, saw the castle way off in the distance, and said &amp;quot;hey, we must be getting close.&amp;quot; Then the train stopped. It seems that Palmela station isn&#39;t actually in Palmela! It&#39;s more on the far side of Aires, the town beside the train tracks. The castle looked very far away indeed, but we figured we were in good shape, so we tightened our shoelaces and started trekking.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, better get walking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aires was nice. Tidy and colourful apartments with nice gardens. A modern school and smooth sidewalks. We were making good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Walking through Aires&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through Aires. The castle road must be around here somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of Aires was the hill with the castle on top. Now how are we going to get up there? My maps.me app didn&#39;t show any access other than the main highway, so we headed on up. The road was busy and the sidewalk got narrower and narrower as the road got steeper, first heading away from the castle then switching back toward it. At its steepest, the road narrowed so there was no sidewalk, then no curb! Just a concrete drain beside the busy road. So we took to the drain. After about an hour of this all told, we arrived at the Palmela cemetary, then a side road where we could duck into town. We jogged into town and into a wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Palmela&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmela is a medieval hillside village that is still active and vibrant today. And it&#39;s beautiful. Windy cobblestone streets with shops and a market and a sun soaked view of the beautiful Barris Valley far below. We had just arrived via the back side of the village, that&#39;s all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;the outside of the cafe&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite cafe in Palmela. It has the best view!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for a delightful lunch at a cafe and then walked across the street to a lookout, where we gazed back at the route we came up. The train station looked way off in the distance. And right in front of us was a wide white gravel road with two people trekking up to us. That looked much quicker! And hey, gravel roads are on my maps.me app too! More on that road later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Looks like a shortcut&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Looks like a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue up to the castle right away, Cindy wanted to stroll through town first and find the market. So we weaved our way through the maze of streets and alleys until suddenly the view opened up and we got this amazing view of the Barris Valley. Beautiful! Sunny and green with an orchard to the right, forest to the left, and a winding road connecting tiny farms and vineyards in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;bustling palmela&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustling Palmela.

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Barris Valley&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Barris Valley. Lovely!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grinned stupidly at each other forever.  Grin to each other, gaze out at the valley below.  Look back at the town.  Grin to each other again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several minutes of grinning and gazing, a waiter from the cafe beside us came up with two glasses of wine from a man sitting at the cafe. I&#39;m not kidding! We drank the wine (even Cindy, who never drinks red wine) and went over to thank the man, Tilak, and he introduced us to his daughter Rita and her partner Nuno. We visited a bit and Cindy show them her photo book of Regina life and then Tilak asked if we had 1/2 an hour and did we want to see more of the valley. Hell yeah! So we all piled into his 4x4 and drove out to the Barris Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valley is lived in and farmed but is also part of a protected area. The landowners and the government work together to keep the valley in its rural state even though there is pressure from Lisbon suburbs on one side an Setubal suburbs on the other. (As Tilak said, the government gives the protections and the landowners pay for everything.) But from the valley floor you forget about the cities on the other side of the hills. It&#39;s just wonderful country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rita drove us over a hill and into the neighbouring Arrabida valley, where they lived. Tilak bought his place 35 years ago and has been slowly turning his piece of the hillside into what he calls a Mediterranean nature preserve. He&#39;s got plants from all over the world there that grow well in the hot Mediterranean climate. Aloe plants from his native Africa. Over 17 species of bamboo from his time working in Asia. All planted in and around the native cork trees and other native plants on his hillside acreage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years he&#39;s also built a number of buildings on his land and they are now turning them into apartments to rent to tourists and house the fire brigade during the dry season. We toured the apartments and would gladly live in any one of them, for months or years. What a glorious place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilak had to get back to Lisbon so we said goodbye to our new friends and he dropped us off at the castle in Palmela at around 4pm. Oh right, the castle! I almost forgot why we went to Palmela in the first place! The good news was we had the place almost to ourselves at that time of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We clamoured all over the castle.  It&#39;s virtually untouched (I only saw one iron railing along extra steep stairs) and we could go all the way to the very top.  No way the authorities would let you get right to the edge at home!   It was thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the view was spectacular!  You could see south to Setubol and across the inlet to the beaches of Troia.  And then we turned north and could see Lisbon way off in the distance.  Filipe told us this was a very strategic castle because of the view and I could really sense that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>To Belem and Back Again</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/to-belem-and-back-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friends of Orange Boot Filipe and Linda both recommended a day trip to Belem, so we headed down to the train station right after my morning trip to the &lt;em&gt;pasteleria.&lt;/em&gt; We went to a new one this morning, a block down from yesterdays&#39;s adventure and whoo boy was it humming.  A man and woman plating pastries as fast as they could.  Another woman constantly pulling shots.  And another man running - and I mean &lt;em&gt;running -&lt;/em&gt; to take food and drinks to tables and return with empty cups and plates.  I barely nudged him with my pack while standing at the bar and I knocked him right out of orbit!  He kept his stack of plates together, barely, but asked us to take a seat after that.The coffee was even better than yesterday and the pastries were great too, but we&#39;ll try a new place tomorrow.  This one was so busy I was quite intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then further down the road to the Mercado da Ribeira, a large indoor market right by the train station, to pick up some fruit for the train ride.  According to our guidebooks, this is the main market, the Granville Island or Pike Place of Lisbon, if you will, but we must&#39;ve got there late because there wasn&#39;t much going on.  Fruit, vegetable, flower, fish and meat vendors, to be sure, but no shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half of the market was a series of restaurant booths.  Like a big food court but with really good looking food, all cooked in open kitchens.  It looked really nice, although all the cooks looked very serious indeed.  We didn&#39;t stop to eat as it wasn&#39;t noon yet and we had a train to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re still getting used to the locals here, especially with regard to the weather.  By the time we reached the train station, which was right along the river, we were down to shirt sleeves.  The sun was out, the wind was calm and it was warm - already 15C.  One  cafe had beach chairs along the water and they were full up with tourists sunning themselves with drinks at hand.  But the locals?  Winter coats and scarves still.  I wonder when spring arrives for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; alt=&quot;deck chairs along the river&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourists sunning themselves beside the river.  The locals are still wearing winter clothes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were expecting a long ride.  The guidebook said 30 minutes by tram and a friend said 40 minutes.  So we made sure to grab nice seats and hunkered down for the ride.  The train was hot and stuffy.  I had a pretty good sweat going and started looking for a window to open but then looked around and everyone else had heavy coats and scarves on.  I guess it still wasn&#39;t warm enough.  So I did some Mark-style meditation and breathing exercises to slow my heart down and cool myself from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train rolled and we came up to one of the two big bridges that span the river.  This one looks a lot like the Golden Gate in San Francisco.  It towered over us and over the city as the freeway passed over the houses to meet the road half way up the hill.  As we went under the bridge, Cindy pointed out the spot where we took pictures of the aqueduct yesterday (the aqueduct goes over the freeway once it meets the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the train slowed down and we were at Belem station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; alt=&quot;Belem train station&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh?  We were on the train less than 5 minutes!  How can this be Belem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off, found a bench and checked the map.  Belem was not much more than 5km from our flat!  We had pretty much walked there yesterday and didn&#39;t know it!  I think what happened is that the 30-40 minute estimates were for trams.  Lots of stops and travelling though the hilly, narrow streets of Lisbon.  But the train is a straight shot on level ground.  Much, quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Belem.  Very, very nice.  Like, gorgeous!  The touristy bits of the area are all along the water and it&#39;s quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you have the river, with a nice walking promenade and an immense sculpture, the Tower of Belem.  The tower sticks out over the river like the prow of a Portuguese caravel, which is exactly the point.  The tower commemorates the Portuguese explorers who were among the very first to colonize much of Africa, Asia and South America (plus coming to Newfoundland too.)  These were the first fellows to bring the riches of the world &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; to the motherland.&lt;/p&gt;

(That&#39;s going to be a common theme on this trip, I&#39;m afraid, so I&#39;ll say it once and be done with it.  Vast riches were secured by a few people, often from colonies around the world.  These riches, and the people of the colonies too, were used to build the magnificent buildings Cindy and I will see all over the trip.  We&#39;re taught to feel guilty about all that today, or at least I do, even though we live in a former colony too.  But still.  These buildings and squares and statues are magnificent.  So I&#39;m going to enjoy them.  End of downers...)
&lt;p&gt;After the river comes a strip of beautiful, manicured parks.  Three in all, each with a central statue or fountain, smooth paths and lots and lots of benches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Marble Fountain in Belem&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the parks is the Main Street, full of colourful houses, then full shops and bars, and then a splendid palace and museum.  The street was crowded with tourists (including these two from Saskatchewan) so we made one pass then moved inland, to stroll through the neighbourhood a little.  We found houses, the football stadium, then lots of gates and barbed wire.  There are several embassies in Belem, and we passed Austria, South Korea, Japan and Peru before we were back downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;park with houses in distance&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belem is famous for a specific pastry, &lt;em&gt;pastel de nata&lt;/em&gt;.  It is a custard tart, ideally served warm and was invented in Belem in 1837.  The shop that made the tart famous is still there and still making them. And even though you can buy &lt;em&gt;pastel de nata&lt;/em&gt; in every &lt;em&gt;pasteleria&lt;/em&gt; in Lisbon, there was a line out the door at this shop.  They&#39;ve apparently done quite well in the past 175 years, since they now have a 400 seat restaurant to go with their takeout line.   We passed, then came back an hour later when the line was gone and bought two tarts plus a pair of duck and mushroom pastries for supper.  We ate them in the nearby park.  Delicious!  The custard is just slightly sweet and it is a real treat when still warm.  Well worth going to the source!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another stroll through the parks, we went back to Lisbon and up to the top of Parque Edouardo VII, which we enjoyed so much yesterday.  But instead of a side trip to aqueducts, we walked back to our flat down the middle - the Avenue de Libertadores.  Two large pedestrian promenades lined with shops so fancy I hadn&#39;t heard of most of them.  We stopped for my afternoon espresso and then took a quick left so Cindy could see one of the &amp;quot;elevators&amp;quot;, a tram on a track that goes up and down the steepest streets.  Wow, and I thought we&#39;d been up some steep roads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevator was at the foot of a magical series of narrow streets and alleyways known as the Restauradores district.  You guessed it.  Restaurants!  Theatres too.  The already narrow streets were full of tables.  Each group of tables had a waiter or restaurant owner with a menu to show to passers by.  &amp;quot;Sir, look at my fish in the window!&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Remember, our name is Santiago!&amp;quot;  And some of the theatres had huge lines of kids camped out for tickets.  I couldn&#39;t figure out who was playing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was another long day of walking, so we grabbed a quick dinner, checked on the kids then went to bed before we could look at our pictures.  So this post will be a little late.  But we have another big day tomorrow so need to sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if it was jet lag, the firm mattress, or the intense cold in our flat but I slept like I haven&#39;t slept in years.  Cindy finally gave me a kick at 9:30 and mentioned we might want to leave the apartment.  So after navigating the teeny shower I dressed in outfit #2 and we hit the cobblestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/f8zamuvduC-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy at the front door of our AirBnb in Lisbon&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day was complete in the first 20 minutes.  We stopped in at a nearby &lt;em&gt;pasteleria&lt;/em&gt; (pastry shop / snack bar) for breakfast like the locals: standing at the bar.  I had a delicious coffee and croissant while Cindy had fresh squeezed orange juice and a sausage pastry.  We were standing between a sweet old lady having the same coffee as me (I wasn&#39;t too shy to point and ask for what she was having) and a young businessman who was in an out while I was still figuring out what to order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was over the moon happy.  I&#39;ve been wanting to have a standup pastry &amp;amp; espresso breakfast &amp;quot;European style&amp;quot; simply for ever.  I&#39;m so glad Sabine used to have her coffee and croissant standing at our hutch when she came to the bakery.  Now I know why she did; what seemed sweet but different in Regina is just the way it&#39;s done here.  And there is literally a pasteleria every block here.  Sometimes two or three!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we walked over to the Feira da Ladra (&amp;quot;the market of thieves&amp;quot;) in the Alfama district.  It was only 3km away but was quite the hike.  They say Lisbon is the City of Seven Hills and I think we covered two of them getting to the market.  We went through Barrio Alto, then Baixa, up and around the back of the castle (Castelo de San Jorge) to a huge cathedral.  Behind and beside the cathedral was a huge arch; we passed through the arch into one of the craziest flea markets ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market was full of, well, everything.  Used books, original art, bowls of old coins, packets of stamps and postcards, posters, and handicrafts.  But also whatever junk and tchotchkes one might have picked up over the years.  Piles of old clothes.  Handmade shoes.  A blanket covered with old, used, possibly hot cell phones.  A bucket of bolts.  Records.  That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around the market and snapped a few pictures, including a stamp and postcard seller for my buddies at the club, and then headed into Alfama.  The Alfama district is renowned for its tight, maze like streets.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like them in all my life.  There was no alley too narrow for a pasteleria, maybe a restaurant, a shop and apartments.  If it was wider it might have a parking garage or even a service station.  We wandered around for an hour or more and pressed tight against the wall if a car (or tram!) came past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in such tight quarters let us take a good look at some of the buildings.  As can be expected in an area that tight, it&#39;s a continuous line of 3-4 story row houses, with the walls coming to within 12-18 inches of the street.  Most of the time you couldn&#39;t walk two abreast without one person having to walk on the street.  But the best part was the tiles!  Many of the buildings were covered in traditional ceramic tiles making a colourful pattern on the wall.  Mostly they were just patterns but we saw one building with tiles making a scene across the whole wall.  I guess this is traditional Portuguese decoration for buildings, and it&#39;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping for a quick lunch (sandwiches and fresh lemonade) we walked to the metro station and took the train up to Parque Eduardo VII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very fancy area, with five star hotels all over the place, but we went to see the park.  It starts with a huge statue in the middle of a roundabout, then a massive green space with a tree lined promenade on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promenade has a substantial slope to it.  We walked and walked to the very top, where there are four large pillars and a big fountain.  The view from the top of the park was amazing!  You could see all the way to the river and  see the castle where we were for lunch just a couple of hours earlier.  It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

Water in the distance, castle on the hill in the distant left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rested at the top of the park for a while then hiked off to find another, smaller park nearby.  Cindy had read about this park in her guidebook - it was right in the shadow of an ancient aqueduct that runs through Lisbon.  What a site!  The park was well treed and shady (nice as we were getting toasted in the sun,) there was a coffee bar at one end and little playground for the kids beside it.  Now we&#39;re talking!  We need one of these park/coffee bars in my neighbourhood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;children&#39;s playground under an aqueduct&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy wanted to see more of the aqueduct so we followed it as best we could till we found a park dedicated to it, about a kilometre or so up the road.  For a small fee you can walk along the top of the aqueduct and get some cool views.  We didn&#39;t really want to get any higher but we walked along it for a few more blocks and got some great snapshots of the aqueduct crossing a freeway and curving off to another hill in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;the aqueduct continuing into the distance&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was a long, twisty, mostly downhill (unless I screwed up the directions) walk back to our flat.  We decided to eat in so after we cooled off a bit we walked down to a nearby market for some vegetables and tried our best to get the oven to work.  We got it figured out and made a nice, simple meal.  And we only blew the main breaker once!&lt;/p&gt;

At least there&#39;s a railing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip of the Day:  A huge thank you to our friend Deborah, who recommended we download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.me/en/home&quot;&gt;maps.me&lt;/a&gt; app for our phones.  I had a map of Portugal on the phone that I could access off-line.  And it could route walking directions!  It saved us in the Alfama.  We never would&#39;ve found the market and for sure we wouldn&#39;t have found the aqueducts without it.  Thanks Deborah!&lt;/p&gt;

That&#39;s it for 3 months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one thing that every single travel guidebook mentions over and over is to PACK LIGHT!  Pack the bare minimum and leave half of that behind.  And really scrutinize the half you keep to see if you can take more weight off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s something to that, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last &amp;quot;Big Trip&amp;quot; was two weeks to Vancouver, Seattle and Victoria in 2014 and that was a dry run on the whole &amp;quot;carry everything on your back&amp;quot; approach.  We borrowed travel packs that Ben and his buddies had taken to Europe.  Filled them to bursting, checked them at the airport, then swore every time we had to take the pack from the plane/train/ferry to our hostel.  It was brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip is much longer and we&#39;re going to visit many more places.  And that means more days lugging our packs.  I don&#39;t want to say &#39;lugging&#39;, even once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&#39;s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One carry on sized, wheeled travel pack per person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One light day bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal, easy to wash, quick to dry clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very little paper (my books and journals often weigh more than my clothes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10kg (22lb) limit per person.&lt;/strong&gt; 9kg is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight limit is really important. There will be days we&#39;ll need to carry all our stuff and hey, I&#39;m not 20 anymore.  10kg is half a bag of flour so I should be able to carry that without too much grumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; alt=&quot;suitcase contents, all laid out&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the stuff. I still wish it was a little less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag:&lt;/strong&gt; Last year I invested in a really good carry-on sized wheeled backpack, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ospreypacks.com/ca/en/product/meridian-convertible-60l-22-MERIDN22_726.html&quot;&gt;Osprey Meridian&lt;/a&gt;, based on the recommendation of the very smart owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robinsonsoutdoors.com/&quot;&gt;Robertson Outdoor Store&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria.  She travels the world, from Poland to Peru and the Meridian is the only bag she takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cool feature is the Meridian comes with a zip off daypack.  When the daypack is off, the big bag meets carry-on restrictions.  Zipped on, I can wheel or carry everything in one streamlined unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve taken a few small trips with my Meridian and it&#39;s a dream as a wheeled bag.  This will be the first trip where I use it as a backpack too; I&#39;m curious to see the proportion of wheeled use vs. backpack use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothes:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m really trying to conserve weight here.  Lightweight pants, 3 shirts, socks and underwear, 1 pair shorts and 1 pair swim trunks.  A fleece and a raincoat.  Shoes and sandals.  We&#39;re going in spring so thankfully won&#39;t have to carry a heavy coat and mitts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics:&lt;/strong&gt; The splurge (money and weight) is my iPad and keyboard setup.  I&#39;ve got travel guides and maps pre-loaded, plus I can blog on the road and FaceTime home too.  It&#39;s worth the weight.  Lots of cables and electrical adapters making the trip too, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy&#39;s carrying her point and shoot camera.  We&#39;ve got an adapter to hook the camera up to the iPad so we can share pictures from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper:&lt;/strong&gt; I can&#39;t get to zero, but I am being strict here.  Two bundles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/&quot;&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt; books for journalling/lists, a watercolour sketchbook, a travelling paint set, pens, pencils and brushes.  I am extremely tempted to take a second sketchbook but will fill the first one and buy another instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy made her own travel guide / journal from the pile of guidebooks we borrowed from the library and is still holding out hope that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp&quot;&gt;Patrick Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; finally publishes his new novel before we get to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Bits:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m banking on Europeans shaving and brushing their teeth, so am taking minimal toiletries.  I&#39;ll buy more when I run out.  And we always seem to collect plastic cutlery, etc. when we picnic, so I&#39;ll get a spork for the next adventure.  A lightweight pack towel was my only splurge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it wouldn&#39;t be a Mark and Cin trip without our Gin Rummy book and a deck of cards.  We&#39;ve had a running game going since 1990 or so.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it.  It all fits in the carry-on bag with lots of room to spare.  But hows the weight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&#39;s bag: 23lbs (10.4kg)&lt;/strong&gt; Argh.  Too many Field Notes?  Too many socks? That iPad+Keyboard put me over the limit a touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cindy&#39;s bag: 21lbs (9.5kg)&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty darn good.  She can carry the toiletry bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell.  If we&#39;re carrying the packs a lot and it&#39;s too much, we can either chuck some stuff, mail it home, or get in better shape...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of planning a long trip is figuring out where to go and what to do.  But do you really need a strict itinerary?  I don&#39;t think so, especially for a trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our son Ben and his buddies went on a six week tour two years ago, they had the trip fully planned before they left Saskatchewan.  All rooms were booked in advance:  Two nights in London, a week in Rotterdam, a week in Lisbon, etc.   They didn&#39;t want to be stressed out finding accommodations while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben&#39;s trip worked pretty well.  One AirBnb host cancelled in the middle of the trip but they had time to rebook.  So they were never searching for rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem they faced was that they couldn&#39;t adjust their plans on the fly.  Bordeaux was boring for four young men, but they had paid for five nights accommodations, so they stayed.  Lisbon was awesome and they&#39;d love to stay longer, but their Barcelona apartment was paid for and waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my trip, I want to avoid too many commitments.  If Evora is amazing, I want to stay longer.  If we get invited to a village bakery, we&#39;re going.  I don&#39;t want to say Sorry I can&#39;t go if an opportunity presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, it helps to have some idea.  So this is what we&#39;re doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I built a calendar for the 93 (!) days we&#39;ll be away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I inked in the two fixed dates:  Arrive in Lisbon, depart via Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We marked in key dates from the Real World.  When&#39;s Easter? (Expect southern Spain to be packed Easter week.)  When are any cool festivals we want to see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used pencil and sticky tabs to block out week long blocks, going forward and backwards.  At the start of the trip, we want to have time to visit more of Portugal than Lisbon, so that gets two weeks.  At the end, we want time to cycle in the Netherlands, so that gets a week.  We want to linger in Paris on route to Holland, so another week there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first run through is like a filled chocolate:  semi-firm on top and bottom, but soft and gooey in the middle.  For example, we really have no clue how we&#39;ll make our way from northern Italy to Paris, although we know we&#39;d like to be in Paris by May 10 at the latest.  And we know that if May is approaching and we&#39;re nowhere near Veneto, we had better re-think things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read through guidebooks and get ideas from our friends, things may firm up a bit.  What&#39;s happening so far is that we&#39;re finding more and more things we want to see. That will increase for sure once we land in a few weeks.  But there are a few people we want to visit so it&#39;s good to at least commit to the month that we&#39;ll be in their country!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to go slow and deep into the places we visit, so the lack of a fixed itinerary will help with this.  We&#39;ll need to make a lot of decisions as we go, but that&#39;s part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know we won&#39;t have enough time to see everything we want on this trip.   Unless we sell the house.  Our kids have instructions of what to do if we call with the &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; code.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Kingdom For A Guidebook</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-kingdom-for-a-guidebook/"/>
		<updated>2016-01-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-kingdom-for-a-guidebook/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;a large stack of travel guidebooks&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of temporary unemployment is there is plenty of time to plan this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our route slowly takes shape, I&#39;ve been getting guidebooks from the library.  And as I read through them, I&#39;ve been putting more books on hold.  We&#39;ve got quite a collection at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#39;ve learned so far is that there is way more to do and see than we can fit in a single trip.  So we&#39;re not going to try.  We&#39;re going to go deep in fewer areas, rather than doing a Rick Steve&#39;s &amp;quot;two days per city&amp;quot; whirlwind tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach has served us well when travelling in Canada.  Our two weeks in Prince Edward Island is half a lifetime compared to the guidebooks - they&#39;d have you on and off the island in 48 hours.  But there is joy and wonderment in the little villages as much as in the famous cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the guidebooks?  I tend to lean toward Rough Guides, even if we&#39;re not going to be staying in hostels very much.  Fodors and Frommers tend to be for people with higher budgets than we have (at least that&#39;s the sense I get.). Lonely Planet might be a good fit but isn&#39;t available at the library much so I haven&#39;t formed an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIth our &#39;go deep&#39; strategy, the individual country or region guides (Portugal, Paris, Andalucia) are a better match than Europe in 500 pages.  The regional books have room for smaller, quirkier places in addition to the big names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;general overview&amp;quot; books have been helpful too.  Rough Guide&#39;s &amp;quot;First Time Europe&amp;quot; or Rick Steve&#39;s &amp;quot;Europe Through the Back Door&amp;quot; get you in the right frame of mind for travelling, rather than talking about where to eat and what to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all this book smarts can only give us the basics of a region.  I can hardly wait to get there and see Europe with my own eyes, meet new people, and follow my nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been too long since Cindy and I were on a big adventure.  After working like crazy at the bakery for the past five years, it&#39;s time to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve always dreamed of a European Tour, but have never been.  So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going.  Roughly counterclockwise from Lisbon, to Italy and north to Paris and the Netherlands.  Or so we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights are booked (into Lisbon, home from Amsterdam.)  Guide books checked out from the library.  A few more weeks of dreaming then we&#39;ll be getting on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends have asked if I&#39;ll be publishing a blog of our adventure.  Well, sure!  Don&#39;t have to ask me twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re getting started early.  Before we leave.  This blog is all about travelling - getting ready, getting there and getting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not travel experts or anything.  We&#39;ve travelled around North America alone and with kids, but we&#39;ve never left the continent.  So I fully expect some of our world traveller friends to cringe while we stumble around our first overseas trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be pretty, but it&#39;ll be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a fun three days.  I decided to make some changes to my hosting setup, which changed the location of this blog among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several emails to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostpapa.ca/&quot;&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; support, including one step that only they could perform, I have my hosting configured properly.  My bakery website is not completely moved to a new hosted wordpress environment [&lt;em&gt;the Rainmaker Platform&lt;/em&gt;] and this host is configured for this blog and a some other blogging ideas I have.  The skeleton of my next project is underway [&lt;em&gt;which turned into the travel blog, Ready With Shoes On&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest unforseen hiccup was that I was without email for two days.  One day for the hosting folks to make their change and one to adjust all my MX records properly.  But even that&#39;s all working now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I used to have a travel blog called &amp;quot;Ready With Shoes On&amp;quot;, so we could send dispatches back home during our epic European tour in 2016.  This was the &#39;About Us&#39; page from the blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi!  We&#39;re Mark and Cindy Dyck and finally, after years of dreaming and planning and plotting and scheming, we&#39;re taking our dream trip to Europe.  Three months of walking and hiking and trains and buses.  We&#39;re so excited we can hardly stand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve dreamed about this trip forever, but there was always something else to do.  Work, raising two amazing kids, setting up house and even opening a bakery.  But the kids are in University now, the bakery is (temporarily) closed and it&#39;s time for adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re Canadian Prairie folk and proud of it.  And we&#39;ve seen most of Canada over the years (typically in a tent!)  But this is our first trip overseas.   We&#39;re going to travel in Europe the same way we travel in Canada - frugally, curiously, openly and with a focus on the adventures one can find in everyday life. We can&#39;t wait to meet new people, make new friends and experience new cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&#39;s the writer.  Cindy&#39;s the photographer.  Together we&#39;re going to share the little gems that make this trip special to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we&#39;ll be sure to share our screw-ups too.  They&#39;ll be a good laugh for our more experienced world-travelling friends and maybe a good lesson for folks who haven&#39;t made the travel leap yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Three Words for 2016</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/"/>
		<updated>2016-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been listening to what &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisbrogan.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt; has to say for at least 8 years now.  One thing Chris does consistently is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisbrogan.com/3-words-2016/&quot;&gt;pick three words&lt;/a&gt; to guide his work and life for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three words.  Way simpler than a vision statement or grand manifesto.  Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, if you&#39;re going to dedicate the entire year to focusing on only three words, they better be pretty good ones.  Broad.  Vibrant. Important.  Talk about pressure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never done this before, but I have been struggling with focus lately (some may say for a long time) so I decided to do the three words exercise this year. I need some direction and it&#39;s gotta come from inside me.  So here goes.  My three words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;present-open-carnal&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Present.   Open.  Carnal. &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooh, deep!   Let&#39;s break this down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;present&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Present &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a really hard time living in the here and now.  I&#39;m either full of regret about the past or worried about the future.  It&#39;s no fun, believe me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#39;m working, walking or talking with friends,  I will focus on the present. What I&#39;m doing, seeing, hearing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I am is much, much better than where I was or where I think I&#39;ll end up.  So let&#39;s love what&#39;s happening around me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;open&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Open &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#39;m caught up inside my head, everyone suffers.  I&#39;m going to open up a lot this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll open myself up to truly listen to people.  Their dreams, desires, problems and joys.  I can better help people if I&#39;m truly listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll share my hopes, dreams and challenges too and ask for help.  There&#39;s no point putting on a strong face if I&#39;m struggling with something.  And there&#39;s no sense being afraid to say what I want to accomplish either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll take a page from &lt;a href=&quot;http://austinkleon.com/&quot;&gt;Austin Kleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/&quot;&gt;show my work&lt;/a&gt;.  If I keep things bottled up till it&#39;s perfect I&#39;ll never ship anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;carnal&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Carnal &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-three-words-for-2016/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a word I picked up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marykarr.com/books.php&quot;&gt;Mary Karr&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s powerful.  Possibly controversial. It&#39;s also perfect, so I&#39;m using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way she uses &amp;quot;carnal&amp;quot; it isn&#39;t referring to sex specifically.  It&#39;s referring to experiencing the world and talking about it, using all one&#39;s senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.  When I write, I&#39;m going to capture everything: the feel, smell, taste and sound of thing I&#39;m describing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to capture the light and colour of the world around me when I paint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I travel, around town or around the world, I&#39;m going to capture everything I experience as vividly as I possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnal is also a reminder to write the truth of what I see and experience.  I often sand off the rough edges of whatever I&#39;m describing so as to not offend anyone.  I&#39;m likely going to turn some people off with my writing this year.  That&#39;s OK.  I&#39;m going to turn others on even more this way, I know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  Three words that will get me out of my head and seeing things in bold, loud, smelly colour.  I&#39;m very excited about the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Fear of Music</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/fear-of-music/"/>
		<updated>2016-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/fear-of-music/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought a premium subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spotify.com/&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; several months ago.  It&#39;s really starting to grow on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose was to have some peace at the bakery.  My Dylan-heavy playlist was getting on the nerves of the other bakers, but I wasn&#39;t willing to listen to their house music or kiddie pop.  The Spotify subscriptions has a wide enough selection of music that there was something for everyone, even (god forbid) customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really cool to be able to think of pretty much any music artist and be able to find their music in one place.  We can get a reggae playlist in seconds.  Same with soul music (you want classic or contemporary R&amp;amp;B?)  New music, old music, rock, country, folk or classical, it&#39;s all there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure there are a few things missing.  The Van Morrison collection is very, very slim, and I can&#39;t find a good version of David Bromberg&#39;s &amp;quot;Testify.&amp;quot;  And the Spotify curated playlists can be woeful (&amp;quot;Your Favourite Coffeehouse&amp;quot; is so mellow I&#39;d need to order 3 extra shots of espresso.)  But Discovery Playlists make up for all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Playlist is a playlist selected just for you.  It&#39;s around two hours long (30 songs or so) and is  based on the music that you pick regularly.  The twist is that the algorithm picks similar music, both old and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new playlist shows up every Monday and exists for only one week.  So I have a week to listen to the whole thing and flag the artists and songs I want to hear more from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a neat trick.  I&#39;m reminded of older artists or albums that I haven&#39;t heard in ages, but the playlist also highlights new artists that I want to check out further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been paying attention to my Discovery playlist for several weeks now.  If there&#39;s a song I like, I add it to a special playlist so I won&#39;t forget it (my Discovery playlist refreshes after a week and I can&#39;t get it back any other way.  That &amp;quot;Master List of Discoveries&amp;quot; now has over 300 songs and I&#39;ll likely add 20 more next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem, and the one that inspired the title of this post, is what the algorithm says about my current musical tastes.  It&#39;s trending towards 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s folk rock and American roots music.  I love it, but my tastes are actually more diverse than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks I&#39;m going to experiment with listening to specific styles to see if they will show up on my Discovery playlist.  Will listening to AC/DC for a week get more hard rock on the playlist?  What about a week of Orchestra Baobab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep you posted.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tell Me What You Want, What You Really Really Want</title>

		<updated>2016-01-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/tell-me-what-you-want-what-you-really-really-want/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just got back from a Christmas holiday to Calgary and Fernie, and not a moment too soon.   Another day or two and I&#39;d end up causing a big fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was great, but highlighted by a series of strange communication errors. Either I would only hear half of what someone was saying, or I&#39;d only say half of what I meant.  So many situations were unnecessarily strained, from arranging a meeting with my aunt and uncle or sorting the recycling as we cleaned out the condo in Fernie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably I&#39;d get frustrated by the misunderstanding.  Of course we were going to meet today!  Clearly this pile is recycling and that is garbage!  Then I&#39;d get accused of being &#39;snippy&#39; which would raise the tension three more levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we had a nine hour drive home where I could stew, mope, then try to figure things out.  I was taken back to a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Crucial-Conversations-Audiobook/B002V5CZ5A&quot;&gt;Crucial Conversations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; class I took years ago where the instructor kept quoting the Spice Girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell me what you want.  What you really, really want!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what I really, really want is smoother, easier, stress free conversations with my friends and family (and I do), then that&#39;s what I need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relax.  Get centred.  Explain in detail what I&#39;m thinking.  Ask for feedback.  Ask for input.  Ensure we have understanding.  Then ensure we agree on the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard for me, because I&#39;m either experiencing life in big gulps and don&#39;t want to stop, or I&#39;m anxious about something and am dancing around the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I&#39;m going to reduce the number of Defcon 4 moments, I better stick to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relax.  Get centred.  Explain in detail what I&#39;m thinking.  Ask for feedback.  Ask for input.  Ensure we have understanding.  Then ensure we agree on the next step.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not really one for New Year&#39;s Resolutions, but it seems I have one this year.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Thanks for this</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(this post is written on my ipad, so is likely festooned with typos. Sorry. When I make my million I shall buy a Macbook like all the cool kids.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(it deserves pictures and links too.  That will need better than this iPad!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the frozen prairies yesterday and flew to the Shangri-la that is Victoria BC. We almost didn&#39;t make it; the fog was so thick and so low that the pilot didn&#39;t think we would be able to land. But we landed OK (I saw the ground 5 seconds before we touched down) and before we were in the city the fog had burned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was spent walking around one of the truly beautiful Canadian cities in brilliant sunshine and +8C weather. I kept muttering, then saying, then shouting &amp;quot;It&#39;s the freaking 8th of January!!&amp;quot; It was glorious. I don&#39;t know why I put up with -30C weather in Saskatchewan every winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 day blogger challenge had a rest day yesterday - no posts required, but we were all asked to meditate on the things for which we were grateful. I think the point is that we&#39;ll be better writers if we write from a more generous and grateful posture. No complaints there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tough to meditate when you&#39;re walking and gawking and staring into the sun though. But by the evening I had some time to sit and think and make a list. I decided to post it anyway. Here we go, in a rather jumbled order, but I want to let it flow and not get into ranking things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Independent Food Purveyors. I admit it. I am a first world, city dwelling, North American man. I have first world problems. I can eat anything and go anywhere. But I have a big problem with the pervasive sameness of chain stores and chain restaurants. I&#39;m so sick of the Walmarts and Costcos and &amp;quot;Original Joe&#39;s&amp;quot; of the world. So here&#39;s a shout out to Willies and Big Wheel Burgers and Fry&#39;s Bakery, three must eat places in Victoria. When I think of this city I think of you first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Farmers, Gardeners, Growers and Millers. You folks care so much and work so hard to take care of the land and make us the best food. Nobody knows you. Nobody gives you the credit you deserve. But without you we&#39;re nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Mother Earth. Gaea. Nature. The Land. Call it what you will but please don&#39;t call it &amp;quot;the environment&amp;quot;. You are beautiful. You are majestic. You are comforting. You are formidable. You are nourishing to body, mind and soul. I may be a city dweller but I feel a deep, deep connection to the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- My parents and sister. From my earliest memory, my mom thought I was brilliant and smart and could do anything. I&#39;ve been driven my whole life to make her proud. I miss her so much. My dad teaches me acceptance every day. To accept people as they are and not as you want them to be. That everyone has their own definition of happiness and contentment. And my sister reminds me that relationships change and morph and grow over a lifetime and are worth working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- My heros and mentors. I&#39;ve been so lucky to have met and been touched by amazing people. In this internet world, I&#39;ve not even met them all face to face, but that&#39;s OK (for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are bakers (thank you Tracey and Nancy and Yvan and Michel and Didier and Eric and Fran and Amy and Leslie and Trent and Craig) some are former co-workers at SaskTel (that&#39;s a whole other post), some are local business owners (hi Rod, hi Aimee.) Bob and Neil just inspire me to keep things weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two people stand out. Seth&#39;s writing and speaking has influenced me more than anyone; he&#39;s pushed me to make a difference in the world every day for over 10 years now. And Bernadette inspires me to think deeply about the people I serve and to make a deeper, meaningful connection with them. They are as important to what the bakery has become as any baker or miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- My friends. I&#39;m come to terms with the fact that I enjoy the company of many, many people, but I don&#39;t have many friends. If it comes right down to it, I have three, but they are lifetime friends. When you get to the point in your life where you&#39;ve been with some of these people for over 30 years, you know there&#39;s something special there. So thank you Kirby, Renee, and Curt. I&#39;m so glad our lives have been intertwined like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- My family. Oh my God how I love my family. To connect with another person the way I have with Cindy is the most amazing thing in my life. To say she makes me complete sounds so corny, but it&#39;s true. She&#39;s my rock when I am drifting. She&#39;ll give space to figure things out but will also give the the kick in the pants I need to keep moving. She&#39;s forced me out of my comfort zone so many times and out of my head when I&#39;m too deep in my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cherish the relationship with my kids so much. I see so much of Cindy in them, and myself, but they are their own unique people too. It&#39;s a miracle really. I love every day with them, good, bad and neutral and have at every stage of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm...if the point of this exercise is to make my heart bigger, it&#39;s worked. My chest is full to bursting. Now I&#39;m off to enjoy another sunny, warm, &#39;winter&#39; day!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Trip Down Memory Lane</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-trip-down-memory-lane/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-trip-down-memory-lane/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is Day 3 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://talk.desk.pm/t/10-days-to-a-better-blog-day-3/826&quot;&gt;10 days to a better blog challenge&lt;/a&gt; and the topic is all about The Writer&#39;s Environment.   What is your writing space like, what rituals do you go through, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t bear to write about my space because it&#39;s a complete and utter mess. My writing space is also my home office, where I do the books, payroll, filing and the like for the bakery.  Well, kinda.  I haven&#39;t filed anything since Thanksgiving and hadn&#39;t really done any book work in a month either.  So my office was a sty. Major cleaning was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a good couple of hours to get to where I could see a work surface, but once I got the momentum going I was really into cleaning.  Next up:  the bakery file system.  That needs cleaning too, but I needed to figure out how to print a list of all the folders in the file system.  How do I do that in Windows 7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled a solution and it turns out that I can do it the same way I could when I was 20.  The good old DOS &amp;quot;DIR&amp;quot; command.  Ahh, DOS.  I haven&#39;t seen the lovely C: prompt in years!  And wow was it quick!  No windows, no icons, just a fast, complete data stream.  I spilled it to a text file, printed it out and I was set to cull. A simple command did the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inordinately happy.  That simple command line, short command, with switches even, took me back to my youth and my first days as a programmer.  It really got me reminiscing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first &#39;professional&#39; jobs was as a Co-op student at SaskTel, back in 1986.  I would configure and install PC&#39;s in peoples offices.  Back in those days, PC&#39;s were expensive -- $3000 or more, heavy, and they didn&#39;t do much.  But if you had Lotus 1-2-3 you could run spreadsheets.  WordPerfect let you write reports (typically business cases to buy more personal computers!) And if you had DataEase you could build a full on database application.  Just memorize the function keys and all the commands and go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/61myZ7uLmy-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/61myZ7uLmy-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/61myZ7uLmy-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/61myZ7uLmy-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;Lotus 123 launch screen&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, if you were stuck on a problem you couldn&#39;t just Google an answer. There weren&#39;t even &amp;quot;Dummies&amp;quot; books.  Everything there was to know was in the big, bulky manual.  Or even a set of them.  Every cubicle had a shelf above the computer desk that was full of manuals for every software package on the computer and they weighed more than the computer.  Including the Operating System.  And the only real operating system was DOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember so clearly how I&#39;d comb through the back of the manual, looking for the command, or series of commands I needed to get my computer to do what I wanted it to do.  Sometimes it would take hours but it was necessary and so much fun too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/NL-zec62E3-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/NL-zec62E3-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; alt=&quot;IBM PC and the several volumes of DOS documentation&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I very clearly remember all the support calls we&#39;d get from users who wouldn&#39;t read their manuals.  They&#39;d never even take the shrink wrap off! Instead they&#39;d call 4135 (how can I still remember that number?!) and we&#39;d answer their question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My favourite all time call didn&#39;t have anything to do with the manual -- a lady called because she missed the disk slot -- she&#39;d stuck her floppy disk between the drive and the computer housing!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my computer today I can do amazing things.  I can write this post and instantly publish it to the world, while listening to the Australia - India Test in the background.  I can edit pictures in seconds and even record a video of me typing if I want.  All in seconds, from my tiny basement office on the frozen Canadian prairies.  But these days I&#39;m always looking for the easiest, best way to do everything within the top 5 Google search results.  I miss the feeling of digging and digging to find the right command to do the simplest of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think Day 11 of this &#39;blogging&#39; challenge might just be taken over with Day 1 of the &#39;Learn Python (or Ruby, or Javascript) in 10 Days&#39; challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be sure to write all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Why I Write</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/why-i-write/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/why-i-write/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking hard today about why I write, why I want to write more and why I want to get better at this.  As can be expected, this is a work in progress, but here&#39;s what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just plain admire writers.&lt;/strong&gt;  Writers who make the complex seem simple. Who make me laugh.  Who make me cry.  Writers who inspire me to live my life fully and do great things.   I want to be one too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing makes me extroverted.&lt;/strong&gt; Deep down I&#39;m a really shy guy.   I&#39;m not the person who&#39;s going to make contact in a crowded room.  It&#39;s a real force of will to make a phone call some days.  But I&#39;m a bolder, more outgoing person when I write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to teach.&lt;/strong&gt; I want you to bake great bread.  I want you to eat great bread.  I don&#39;t ever want you to have a bad meal or a bad outing in Regina, or any city I&#39;ve been to.  I want to be a better person and help you be a better person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;want to entertain you.&lt;/strong&gt; A nod.  A smile.  A belly laugh.  I want to be the guy who makes your day better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I write to make sense of things.&lt;/strong&gt;  There are a lot of ideas rolling around in my noggin and writing helps me make sense of my own thoughts.  I&#39;ve written several posts that start as a problem and then have to be re-written, since the act of writing about the problem opens up the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I write to silence my inner critic.&lt;/strong&gt;   Left to its own devices, my mind will destroy me.  Oh yes it will.  90% of the time my lizard brain is telling me I&#39;m no good, I&#39;m a fraud who will soon be found out, and I&#39;m better off just quitting everything and go for a nap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line for me is that &lt;strong&gt;I write to touch people.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it&#39;s a blog post or a love note.  Whether I get a comment or it just fades away.  I want to make a connection with you and change you a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it&#39;s as simple as &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/_site/blog/2013-03-praise-for-the-unsliced-loaf/&quot;&gt;slicing your own bread.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Proper Meals</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/proper-meals/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/proper-meals/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was inordinately happy at suppertime today.  Ben and Robyn and her friend Josh were all home for supper.  Cindy and I made a nice, simple pasta dish, with a salad and garlic toast.   We started cooking at 5pm and sat down to eat at 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may sound rather boring but we needed to be on vacation to pull off a standard, nothing fancy but made from scratch meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I miss the most about life “before the bakery” is the absence of proper meals.  That is, supper made at home, served between 6pm and 7:30pm, and eaten at a table by at least two or maybe all four of us.  Our crazy sleep patterns mean that this very rarely happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?  Time, really.  Time of day, that is.   Cindy and I typically get home from the bakery between 1pm and 2pm and our bodies are screaming for lunch.  Aside from a snack at the bakery we really haven’t eaten a meal since 3:30am and that is typically a bowl of cereal or some toast.  So by lunch time we are hung-a-ry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a big lunch at 2 means we’re not really hungry at 5, so who wants to make supper then?  Not me, that’s for sure.  And maybe I’m up for a snack by 7:30, but I thought one’s not supposed to eat and then go straight to bed.  I try to get to bed by 8pm, 9 at the latest so a proper supper is always crashing in on my bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the proper solution is to make supper when Cindy and I get home from work, even if it’s at 2pm.  Then the kids have something to eat at a more normal time, even if it’s left overs.  And we get more time for things to settle before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to get the energy to cook after a long day of baking.  That’s a lot of time spent in a kitchen! But it’s worth it if that means we can eat better and maybe lose our ‘too much drive thru’ pudginess.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Travel Plans</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I are heading off to Victoria for a few days later this week for a rest and some warmer weather.  It was -33C this morning so even rainy and +6C will feel pretty darn nice.  And we get to visit with our great friend Renee.  AND, it&#39;s off-season, so we got a suite in the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://oswegovictoria.com/&quot;&gt;Oswego Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in James Bay for barely half what the Super 8 in Estevan costs these days.  Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D0XsrXcP6A-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D0XsrXcP6A-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D0XsrXcP6A-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/D0XsrXcP6A-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Provincial legislature in Victoria, BC&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our hotel is just behind this little building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy these little mid-winter getaways.  Victoria is a lovely city to walk in -- lots of coffee shops, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.russellbooks.com/&quot;&gt;best used bookstore ever&lt;/a&gt;, and some fine &lt;a href=&quot;http://pizzeriaprimastrada.com/&quot;&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bubbyrosesbakery.com/&quot;&gt;bakeries&lt;/a&gt;.  Great breakfasts too.    But my highlight will be getting to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frysbakery.com/&quot;&gt;Fry&#39;s Bakery&lt;/a&gt; when they are open!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two times I&#39;ve been to Victoria, Byron has been closed.  We bakers seem to take a break at the same time.  But I checked and he&#39;s open this weekend.  I&#39;ve already sent an email offering to tote flour and do dishes one night so I can watch him do his thing.  I hope he&#39;s up for some company!  If he agrees I&#39;ll be sure to have a full report on the Orange Boot blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s entirely possible this is my only trip this year, unless the Bread Bakers Guild is going to offer a class I can&#39;t refuse.  The next vacation I want to take is Paris, and that&#39;s going to take some saving and planning.  Spring 2016 is my best guess for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having typed that though, I can&#39;t imagine staying here all year.  Camping maybe? That would be nice...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Travel Rewards</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I are taking the kids up to Saskatoon today for a little R&amp;amp;R.  It&#39;s harder and harder to sneak away these days, what with the bakery taking all our time and University, friends and the bakery taking all the kid&#39;s time.  But travelling together has always been a big part of our lives and I don&#39;t want that to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jsNcDmsJQo-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jsNcDmsJQo-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jsNcDmsJQo-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/jsNcDmsJQo-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;489&quot; alt=&quot;Ben Camping&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben camping in Clear Lake, Manitoba, 1996&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We instilled the travel bug in Ben and Robyn early in life.  It started with camping.  We took to Duck Mountain park when he was two weeks old and kept on camping and travelling -- Waskesiu, Clear Lake and even the Winnipeg Folk Festival when he was 13 months old.  We even fit a car &amp;amp; motel trip to Vancouver Island in his first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Robyn was born we had to switch from the tent to cabins for a year or so but by the time she was two years old we were back in the tent.  We went all over, from the BC Interior to the Ontario Border in the summer and up to the Cabin in the Woods at McPhee Lake in February.  We had a log book of the best parks and the best tent sites in those parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ou_IOGURJs-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ou_IOGURJs-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ou_IOGURJs-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Ou_IOGURJs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; alt=&quot;Mark, Robyn, Ben on the beach in Nova Scotia, 2010&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nova Scotia, 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the kids were seven we wanted to see more of Canada so there were two long trips to the Maritimes and a month on Vancouver Island, still in the same small tent.  By the time Ben was 14 he was getting too long for the end of our four person tent but we still crammed in there.  It was unthinkable to use anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so glad we instilled the travel bug in our kids.  They&#39;ve got it bad.  Both have been to Japan on exchange trips.  Ben&#39;s been to Brazil twice.  They&#39;ve both been to Europe.  And they took advantage of every school band trip and ski trip they could.  At any point in time one of them is planning a new trip somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/j4Xuozxtji-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/j4Xuozxtji-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/j4Xuozxtji-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/j4Xuozxtji-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; alt=&quot;Ben and Robyn at the U20 World Cup, Victoria, covered in face paint&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;U20 Football (Soccer) World Cup, Victoria, 2007. Six nations festooned on two kids!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Travel has helped us see and be part of other cultures.  It&#39;s helped us appreciate what we have in Regina but also fueled the desire to bring the best of our travels back home.  Orange Boot Bakery exists because of all the awesome bakeries we discovered on our travels, from Saskatoon to San Francisco and Victoria to Mahone Bay.  Each one left us thinking &amp;quot;why don&#39;t we have that at home?&amp;quot; and now,  in a small way, we do.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Make Something Happen</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/make-something-happen/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/make-something-happen/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m nearly six hours into 2015 as I write this and maybe it’s too soon.  I mean, I just had my first real sleep in a month.  How I can I possibly reflect on such a crazy year?  But I had one of those “this must mean something” dreams last night so maybe it’s a good time to reflect after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I barely made it over the finish line yesterday.  I thought we baked way too much for New Years Eve and that over tired, ultra depressive funk set in.  We baked too much.  Nobody’s coming today.  What will we do with all this bread?  All our charities are closed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the regulars started coming in to stock up for the next two weeks and when all was said and done, and I gave the last of the buns away to a fellow who came in after we cashed out, all that was left was a small box of sweets for Kylle and Scarlett (our heroic counter crew) a medium box for Joel (our amazing evening cleaner) and three loaves of bread for Cindy and I to take home.  We’ll have good toast for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re closed now for a couple of weeks for our annual January vacation.  It’s a chance to recharge, get caught up on the bookkeeping and the housework, maintain our equipment and maybe reconnect with my family a little.  And Cindy and I will need a few days to figure out what to do in 2015.  Lots of change afoot and pretty much all of it scares me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the dream I had last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1A1fIk_uXN-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1A1fIk_uXN-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1A1fIk_uXN-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1A1fIk_uXN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;507&quot; alt=&quot;photo of Muddy Waters&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dream, for some reason, I wanted to book a big band into the bakery as entertainment.  Must have been for our Annual Open House in June.  I arranged for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddy_Waters&quot;&gt;Muddy Waters&lt;/a&gt; to play.  A legend!  He’s long since passed on, but hey, it was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s the day of the Open House and Muddy and around 10 musicians are coming into the bakery.  I’m scrambling around to get them chairs, and drinks, and snacks.  One wants a coke, the other a beer, the third ice cream.  That kind of thing.   I was scurrying around like Bilbo when the dwarves came by at the start of The Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Muddy and I are sitting down and he gives me the performance contract to sign.  It’s for $20,000.   Twenty Thousand Dollars. Urp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, there is no way, in a year even, that I’m going to be able to put away $20,000.  Can’t be done.  What was I thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the rest of the dream is spent worrying about how I’m going to tell Muddy Waters, the Living Legend (in the dream, anyway), who has travelled all the way to Orange Boot, with a full band that there’s no way I can pay him.  That the concert can’t happen.  That maybe we should’ve talked about prices on the phone before they headed north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you have that conversation?  When’s the right time?  How can I get him alone?  What if he gets mad – maybe I need backup!  How do I start?  What do I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do I tell all of you?  What do I tell the people who came to the bakery looking for Bread and Blues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter.  It’s got to be done.   So I wait until Muddy is off by himself, looking at a picture on the wall, and I go up to him.  Hey Muddy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up. Angry. Angry at myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #1 thing that was in my head was that I was about to cancel an awesome concert because I didn’t have $20,000.  Instead, I should have tried everything I could possibly think of to come up with the money.  Make ten posters, a hundred phone calls and a thousand personal appeals to raise the money and make the concert a reality.  Be an Impresario.  The Guy Who Makes Things Happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wandered down to the kitchen, made some toast (yum), spread on some of Jennifer’s Apple Jelly (thanks Jen!) and thought hard about the dream.  Am I really making things happen, at home and at the bakery, or am I hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an opportunity to do something amazing is sitting there right in front of me, will I take it?   Have I made a strong enough connection with you that you’ll be part of it too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I have.  Not this past year, anyway.  I’ve been hiding at the workbench and the mixer and the dish sink.  I’ve spend too much time hiring people to do what we already do, rather than hiring people to do new, amazing things. And I haven’t spent enough time connecting with people so that when all we need is a thousand people to kick in $20 each to Do Something Amazing, we can pull it off together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that Cindy and I aren’t here only to bake bread and muffins.  We’re here to be part of your world, part of the community, so we can do great things together.  I’ll be working on that this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over to you:  what Amazing Thing are you dreaming about for 2015?  How can I help?  Leave a comment and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Arsene Ben</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/arsene-ben/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BrwcNr88xL-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BrwcNr88xL-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BrwcNr88xL-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BrwcNr88xL-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; alt=&quot;Ben coaching soccer&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning 18 can be a traumatic time for a young adult. These days, instead of representing endless possibilities, an 18th birthday can leave one staring into a huge, empty void. High level organized sports stop at age 18 for all but the tiny tip of the pyramid. With the end of high school comes the end of band, choir and musicals for most kids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really noticed this until I watched Ben graduate from high school this summer. A nice banquet, some awards, a final concert or two, then it was over. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s touched his trumpet since and has only picked up his guitar a handful of times. Instead, it&#39;s on to grown up things like working and figuring out his future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben&#39;s soccer career also made a big shift, although that took until October. His club team qualified for Nationals as Saskatchewan champions, so Ben spent Thanksgiving in Newfoundland squaring off against powerhouses from BC and Ontario. But then, it was over. The next level is University soccer, but Ben&#39;s not interested. So his competitive &#39;career&#39; is over, although he is loving playing on a recreational adult team once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was thrilled when Ben was asked to help coach his former high school team. He worked with the rookie goalkeepers and gave pointers to the back line. It seems like he took a turn at some of the drills too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a solid midfield and blazingly fast forwards, his team won the City Championship last night and Ben was all dressed up on the sidelines. I think he was as happy with this medal as the one he won as a player in Grade 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head coach insisted on suits for the coaches for the final game, joking that he wanted to look like Pep Guardiola. In my mind Ben looks a little like a young Arsene Wenger. Likely just a proud father vision there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Ben keeps coaching. That&#39;s something that can last well past 18, or even 36. Who knows, maybe he can get me tickets to an Arsenal game one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got the notification emails that Posterous was shutting down and I should back up all my posts, I didn&#39;t worry about it. Ignored them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No worries!&amp;quot; said I. &amp;quot;I already pushed every post to my Wordpress blog at time of posting. I&#39;ll be fine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the words pushed over, but all my pictures linked back to the copy at Posterous. Seeing how I was doing more and more short posts with lots of pictures, that means most of the posts I made from 2009-2011 now have big blank spaces where the pictures should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that means I need to get off my butt and start posting more. OK! I&#39;m up for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Robyn and I are on the second leg of our hockey weekend. Yesterday was Swift Current. This morning we headed southeast to Glentworth Sk to face the Wood River Whirling Dervishes (at least I thin that&#39;s there name.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great drive. We saw a coyote and several deer, including a large buck. The remoteness was fascinating and overwhelming. I&#39;d have a lot of trouble adjusting to living 100km+ from the nearest grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped for some pics halfway along the 170km drive from Swift Current.&lt;/p&gt;

Well worth reading the full article (here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/eaUVI7&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/eaUVI7&lt;/a&gt; ). Not dissing the level of feedback at SaskTel; we have several programs like he recommends, but it&#39;s a good reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan&#39;s article reminds me of two cool TED videos on gaming culture and how feedback from games can be used for good. There&#39;s a connection here, I can feel it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the time I&#39;m writing this, Ben&#39;s on his way to the Narita airport outside Tokyo on his way home from 10 days in Japan.  He&#39;ll be home in slightly over 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve known for three years now that he&#39;d be halfway around the world without us, ever since he was selected to be part of the Regina-Fujioka Student Exchange program, but I never expected the immense emotional strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, it&#39;s not worry that I&#39;m feeling.  Never was, really.  What I&#39;m feeling is a strange mix of fierce pride (both in how Ben works hard to accomplish his dreams and how he carries himself around other people), coupled with a strange melancholy.   I mean, if he can travel to Japan with 22 other kids and three chaperones and stay with people he&#39;s only met via email, does that mean he&#39;ll be backpacking around the world on his own soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly, will he take me with him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren&#39;t 10 minutes from the house when we found the Little Pond Community Centre, with two sweet ladies baking inside. Twelve of the best (and cheapest) cinnamon rolls were hastily purchased, warm from the oven, along with a plate of lemon squares. Yum yum!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have great views off the back lawn, with a massive sandbar which will be a joy to explore around. Just not today. We&#39;re collectively pressing our luck with the weather and will travel to Cavendish on the sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I better hit Publish now as we&#39;re loading up the cars. Off to find a tiny village with tourist stuff, a nice beach, stuff for the kids to do, shopping, scenic vistas, crashing surf, fishing boats, a used bookstore, a river, no bugs and possibly a Walmart.

&lt;p&gt;They don&#39;t have campfire fireplaces in PEI parks. It&#39;s just a hole in the grass with the red sand underneath. So cooking is a new and interesting challenge. We were up for it, although the menu was simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we move to the house we rented for the last leg of our trip and join up with Cindy&#39;s family. I look forward to having a home base but might still pitch the tent for old time&#39;s sake. Our old tent has served us well for nearly 20 years but with the kids growing there&#39;s not much extra room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail started like a trip through the Forbidden Forest, and by the time we made it to the headlands we couldn&#39;t see a thing. We spent about 30 minutes taking pictures of the nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just as we were heading back down the trail, the skies cleared. We hurried back to a glorious view of French Mountain, the headlands, and the ocean. We could see clear across to Cheticamp. Well worth the wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also cool to run into Monica Rivers and her family on the trail, who are also from Regina. Small worl indeed...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every winter I get a copy of the Vesey&#39;s Seed Catalogue in the mail. The vegetables pictured in the catalogue always get me pumped for spring. One of my favorite pictures is of Howard Dill&#39;s &amp;quot;Atlantic Giant&amp;quot; pumpkins. These are the World Record pumpkins, routinely over 600 pounds each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, as we left the Annapolis Valley and headed to Nova Scotia&#39;s Eastern Shore, we took a detour to Windsor, NS to check out the Dill Farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of a single pumpkin plant that is ready to be pollinated. They&#39;ll pollinate 1 fruit per stem and then cull back to the two fruits which are growing the fastest (ideal is two inches per day!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That single plant gets the entire bed all to itself; it will take the whole 20x20 bed to feed those massive squash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d love to come back in seven weeks and see how they&#39;re shaping up!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re retracing your steps from five years ago, you just have to go for it, no matter what the weather. Today that meant a trip to Marguerite Beach on Nova Scotia&#39;s Eastern Shore. It&#39;s a beautiful white sand beach that just screams out for playing in the surf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did just that - fog or no fog - and had a great time. The water was absolutely freezing, but that&#39;s what the Atlantic is all about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great day that we topped off the same way as our first trip - fish and chips and a lobster roll at the little red shack at the side of the road at Musquodoboit Harbour. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We left Halifax, heading south along the South Shore. Beautiful old cottages (houses really) dotted along miles of bays and small islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took the side road to check out the lighthouse at Peggy&#39;s Cove. Beautiful! Spent an hour or so climbing on the huge rocks and seeing what we could from the fog. It was very pleasant weather but very foggy on the point.&lt;br&gt;
Last time we were here there was a post office in the lighthouse, but now the post office is closed down. I guess they painted the lighthouse last year and found mould inside, so shut everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought mould could be cleaned or treated or something, but I guess not at a government operation? Not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sure seems mould is more scary to North Americans than Al Qeida these days. &amp;quot;Holmes on Homes&amp;quot; needs to take some of the blame (OMG! MOULD!! Tear it all down!!!). Maybe I should start Moldy Mark&#39;s Home Cleaning and make my fortune...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of the thrill of travelling without an itinerary is that one is often hungry or tired without knowing where the next meal or bed is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the situation today, as we left Lunenburg in the 35C heat and headed overland to Annapolis Royal and then east to Bridgetown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we got to Bridgetown it was 7:30PM and the whole town was shut down. On Friday night in July, no less. So camping at Valley View wasn&#39;t going to work (we had no food.). Quick decision: head northeast toward Wolfville, find food on the way, and a place to stay after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later, I hear Cindy shout &amp;quot;Pearlesfishburgershotdogsicecream!!&amp;quot; I pulled a hard left into an amazing shack by the side of the road. It&#39;s in the middle of nowhere, if you don&#39;t count the 30 cars around the lot and the lineup in front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burgers were awesome and the fish was huge, if a little &amp;quot;moist&amp;quot;. Just what we needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&#39;s see if we can find a motel...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;July 3 was the 100th Anniversary of the Silverson family farm south of Kayville and Ormiston, Saskatchewan.  That particular farm was settled by my mother&#39;s Grandfather, although the surrounding farms were also settled by cousins (or soon to be cousins) who immigrated from Romania between 1911 and 1920.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I often heard stories of how busy and bustling the surrounding villages of Kayville, Ormiston, Crane Valley and Wheatstone were, now they are essentially ghost towns.  Even Terry Silverson, who keeps the farm running, lives and works in Regina (130km away) during the week.  But this weekend the farm was humming as aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents came from as far away as Calgary, Prince Albert and Windsor, Ont. to visit and reminisce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a lot of pictures of friends and family but I was most struck by the beauty of the area.  Even on a &#39;busy&#39; Saturday you&#39;d be hard pressed to see four trucks drive down the grid road; it was just us, the birds, the wind, and the colours.  Brilliant green grass (we&#39;ve had record rains this spring), bright yellow canola, fluffy white clouds and the amazing deep blue summer sky.   You can see for miles and get lost at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I&#39;m a little late on this, because it the announcement came in February. But i&#39;m very excited to learn there is a new version of Civ coming out in the Fall. Civilization IV is my all time favourite PC game and I can hardly wait for the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Civ IV came out in 2005, gamers all over had to upgrade their PCs to handle the graphics and calculation complexity. I wonder if this will be the excuse I need to upgrade my laptop!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Shirky’s myth of complexity</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay Shirky has given us a surprising number of Internet myths. And by this I mean not falsehoods but the opposite: Broad, illuminating ways of making sense of what’s going on. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html&quot;&gt;Clay’s post about the power law distribution&lt;/a&gt; of links in the blogosphere (based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.6561&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;research by Cameron Marlow&lt;/a&gt;) changed how we view authority, fame, and success in the Web ecosystem, and provided the structure within which Chris Anderson could point to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail&quot;&gt;Long Tail&lt;/a&gt;. And Clay’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&quot;&gt;Ontology Is Overrated&lt;/a&gt; made clear that a change in how we categorize our world affects very real power relationships; that essay was highly influential, including on my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com&quot;&gt;Everything Is Miscellaneous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay’s new post — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/04/the-collapse-of-complex-business-models/&quot;&gt;The Collapse of Complex Business Models&lt;/a&gt; — gives us a broad way of understanding why those who used to provide us with content will not be the ones who give us content in the future…and why they cannot fathom why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/category/media/&quot; title=&quot;View all posts in media&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; --&amp;gt; Tagged with: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/tag/everythingismiscellaneous/&quot;&gt;everythingIsMiscellaneous&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/tag/everything_is_miscellaneous/&quot;&gt;everything_is_miscellaneous&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/tag/media/&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/tag/shirky/&quot;&gt;shirky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Clay Shirky&#39;s post via Joho the Blog, so I want to credit the source. But be sure to click through on the link &amp;quot;The Collapse of Complex Business Models&amp;quot; and read it three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of you work for large companies or institutions who are trying to &#39;simplify the business&#39; or design simple products? How many of you have been trying for at least 15 years? I have, and it doesn&#39;t seem to work. I think Clay is on to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 14 or so I used to spend my spring break at my Aunt&#39;s in Calgary. Mom would put my sister and me on the bus, or the train, or in the passenger seat of my cousin Barry&#39;s semi and we&#39;d hang out for a week in Cowtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part was the walk from my aunt&#39;s apartment to downtown. We&#39;d leave around 9AM and walk by ourselves, in the cool morning sun, breathing the crisp clean air (inbetween the diesel fumes of the big trucks), stopping at cool shops along 17ave or 14st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;d meet our aunt for lunch before wandering around downtown for the afternoon, then meeting again to drive home at 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What fun for a teenager! Who would ever let their kids do this today? I wouldn&#39;t, and I bet my aunt wouldn&#39;t either. But it didn&#39;t seem like a big deal 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken right back to 1980 this morning as I walked from the car dealership (new tires) to Robins for a coffee. Cool morning, crisp clean air, and brilliant sunshine. Sure, it&#39;s the Regina Auto Mile and not 17ave, but it sure felt great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest, which featured a $40,000 prize, was organized by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/defense_advanced_research_projects_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.&quot;&gt;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to develop new ways to understand how information is disseminated through social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning group, a small team at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory Human Dynamics Group led by a physicist, Riley Crane, took just eight hours and 56 minutes to complete the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balloons, which were 8 feet in diameter, were arrayed around the country. Some were in highly trafficked locations like Union Square in San Francisco; others were in more obscure places, like Katy Park, a baseball field in the Houston suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning researchers, who specialize in studying human interactions that emerge from computer networks, set up a Web site asking people to join their team. They relied on visitors to the Web site to invite their friends. They also sent e-mail messages inviting people to participate and sent a small number of advertisements to mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said that they would dole out the prize money both to chains of individuals who referred people who had correct information on the balloons locations and to charities. They described their method as a recursive incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach rewards people who make real contributions, said Dr. Crane, whose research has recently focused on how information spreads in computer networks, like YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform an experiment at a massive scale, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the simplest case, a single person who contributed the correct answer would be given $2,000 and the research group would give another $2,000 to charity. In cases where multiple people contributed, participants will get some fraction of $4,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said they had received contributions from 4,665 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got a huge amount of participation from shockingly little money, said Peter Lee, a DARPA project manager who was one of the organizers of the Network Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DARPA had begun holding similar events focused on autonomous vehicles in 2004 to create incentives to quickly advance the state-of-the-art. In the Network Challenge roughly 500 teams had made a serious effort and come close to identifying all of the balloons in a contest that Dr. Lee referred to as a nail-biter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said while they were planning the event the DARPA scientists had wondered about the relative effectiveness of different motives ranging from profit to working for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final results all of the motives seemed to be effective, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said their technique could be used for many things, including finding criminals and missing children and halting impending terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Copyright’s Creative Disincentive</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you follow the debate around digital copyright at all, you&#39;ll like this article by David Weinberger. There&#39;s a consultation on Canadian copyright going on right now -- well worth getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;copyright-s-creative-disincentive&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tucowsinc.com/news/2009/08/copyrights-creative-disincentive/&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Copyright’s Creative Disincentive&quot;&gt;Copyright’s Creative Disincentive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/copyright-s-creative-disincentive/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 31st, 2009&lt;/strong&gt; | Written by David Weinberger with intro by Elliot Noss | &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/copyright-s-creative-disincentive/&quot;&gt;Jump to comments&lt;/a&gt; Filed Under: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tucowsinc.com/news/category/policy/&quot; title=&quot;View all posts in Policy&quot;&gt;Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucows is participating in the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;http://copyright.econsultation.ca/&quot;&gt;Canadian copyright consultation&lt;/a&gt;. We will be making a formal submission and I will be appearing at the final round table tomorrow (Tuesday, September 1, 2009) in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are big fans of government embracing the Internet in order to better get input from its citizens to help with the legislative process. While the methods have evolved, the submissions tend to be very formalistic. By lawyers for lawyers. To try and evolve that we have commissioned an original piece by the brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/&quot;&gt;David Weinberger&lt;/a&gt; discussing &lt;strong&gt;the fundamental misconception in linking copyright to creativity&lt;/strong&gt;. This piece will form the bulk of our submission and follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition we &lt;em&gt;urge&lt;/em&gt; Canadians to contribute to the process. A fantastic resource on how to do so is &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakoutoncopyright.ca/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We all owe a big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelgeist.ca/&quot;&gt;Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt; for his hard work in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My oral comments tomorrow in Peterborough will focus on the role of service providers and how they are being miscast in this dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucows’ views can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe any legislation should be technologically neutral. A DMCA-like approach that considers a technology or a non-infringing use of a technology illegal per se is a huge brake on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe that fair dealing should be expanded to provide greater innovation and creator opportunities. Culture builds on culture and in order to derive the full benefit of the magic of the Internet we need to recognize that the Internet has sped up the dissemination of culture which naturally creates greater opportunities for sharing and extending. This is inherently a feature not a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe that service providers should be neither policemen nor tax collectors for the existing rights holders. Service providers should be focused on helping ordinary Canadians use the Internet more easily and more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please speak out and please enjoy the work that follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;copyright-s-creative-disincentive-1&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Copyright’s Creative Disincentive &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/copyright-s-creative-disincentive/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument seems simple: (a) If every time you put apples out on your fruit stand, they’re immediately stolen, pretty quickly you’ll stop putting out apples. (b) What’s true of your physical property is also true of your “intellectual property.” (c) Therefore, without a system of strong copyright, creators will have no incentive to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about that argument is that it makes a factual claim: Weaken copyright and you decrease innovation. That the facts so resoundingly, enthusiastically, thumpingly dispute that conclusion tells us that the syllogism is wrong. Indeed, the facts say the syllogism has it backwards. Current copyright laws are holding back the innovation they were intended to spur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument gets one crucial point exactly right: Copyright grants creators temporary monopolistic control over the publishing of their works in order to serve a larger social goal: to maximize cultural innovation, production, and sharing. But the syllogism is wrong because it misunderstands the role of incentives, and it misunderstands them so blatantly that it seems unlikely to be accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creators often do have financial incentives. Just like everyone else. Some artists want to make enough to quit their day job. Some want to get rich. Some want to make enough to pay for the materials they need. Some want to prove to themselves that their work is appreciated. Some want to prove it to their parents. The amount of money they need in order to keep creating varies as widely as the role and meaning of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within any one class of incentive, the effect of money on creativity is rarely a straight line. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Richler&quot;&gt;Mordechai Richler&lt;/a&gt; would not have written four times as many books if his advances had been four times larger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guess_Who&quot;&gt;The Guess Who&lt;/a&gt; might be tempted to release more recycled compilations if you pay them enough money, but their songs would not have gotten 1% better for every 1% their revenues went up. Thus, while copyright may provide a financial incentive that enables many creators to create, stronger copyright that results in more money does not necessarily result in more creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, how long would it take you to list the bands that have gotten worse as they’ve gotten richer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most important creative cultural works, money is an enabler but not the reason the person is putting pen to paper, chisel to stone, or camcorder to eye socket. There are so many other reasons people create — from G-d whispering to them, to a neurological itch that can’t otherwise be scratched, to wanting to get laid. Copyright could do its job — facilitate an innovative, sustainable culture — if it aimed merely at enabling creators to create, rather than thinking that the creativity-to-financial-reward curve is a straight line angled at 45 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there would be no problem with setting up a system of laws that overemphasizes the financial incentives for creators if that system had no other effects. But it does, especially now that culture and economics have slipped the bonds of the old physics. Even if we devised a copyright law that provided the absolutely right amount of incentive for every creator to keep on creating, it takes more than motivated creators to build a creative, innovative culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes culture. It takes culture to build culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney&quot;&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; recycling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm&quot;&gt;Brothers Grimm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King&quot;&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt; doing variations on a theme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker&quot;&gt;Bram Stoker&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce&quot;&gt;James Joyce&lt;/a&gt; mashing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer&quot;&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt; up with, well, everything, there’s no innovation that isn’t a reworking of what’s already there. An innovative work without cultural roots would be literally unintelligible. So, incentives that require overly-strict restrictions on our use of cultural works directly diminish the innovativeness of that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are in front of us, in overwhelming abundance. The signature works of our new age are direct slaps in the face of our old assumptions about incentives. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; was created by unpaid volunteers, some of whom put in so much time that their marriages suffer. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; has more beautiful photos than you could look at it in a lifetime. Every sixty seconds, people upload &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/05/zoinks-20-hours-of-video-uploaded-every_20.html&quot;&gt;twenty hours (72,000 seconds) of video to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; — the equivalent of 86,000 full-length Hollywood movies being released every week. For free. The entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Genesis&quot;&gt;Bible has been translated into LOLcat&lt;/a&gt; (”Oh hai. In teh beginnin Ceiling Cat maded teh skiez An da Urfs, but he did not eated dem.”) by anonymous, unpaid contributors, and while that might not be your cup of tea — it is mine — it is without dispute a remarkably creative undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just these large, collaborative projects. There are sites that every day aggregate the quirky, the awe-inspiring, the beautiful, the maddening…so many that there are sites that aggregate the sites that aggregate the sites that aggregate the works. All for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the works that are being produced — the facts on the ground, so to speak — you can get a glimpse of what is actually driving this creativity. It’s sure not the money. At site after site, amateurs — those who create for the love of it — produce and post works that are responses to other works. Sometimes they are responses to other amateurs. Sometimes they are responses — often mocking — to what the mainstream, paid culture has produced. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/copyright-s-creative-disincentive/&quot;&gt;Auto-Tune the News&lt;/a&gt; turns mainstream news footage into politically astute, satiric music videos. In either case the incentive is clear: It is culture itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is culture’s incentive. Works are the spur for creating more works. The greatest prompter of creativity is other creativity. Money is sometimes an enabler. But that has nothing to do with copyright laws that protect works for 70 years after the artist is dead. If enabling a culture of innovation is our aim, then cranking up the copyright protection dial to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY&quot;&gt;eleven&lt;/a&gt; is exactly the wrong way to go. Increasing the volume doesn’t make the music better. Access to more music makes the music better. The connections among people spurs the creativity that creates more connections that create more creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, excessive copyright protection, like a virus, seems to sicken innovation in every field it touches. Indeed, the industries currently trying to survive the digital upheaval by holding onto strict copyright enforcement laws are the ones that have been least innovative in coming up with new business models. Copyright is making them blind to the present and fatally uncreative about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should learn a lesson from what’s going on around them. After fifteen years of the Web making it easier to spread a work than contain it, and far easier to distribute it than to delete the existing copies, we now know some things for sure: People will create more than we can ever take in, without regard for financial recompense. Creators are carried forward by the creative swell around them. Culture enables more culture. And innovation overall is damaged by protectionism at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural opportunity before us is truly epochal. Yet, from the comedy of pretending that we’re looking out for the rights of little-known poets and singer-songwriters, we’re pushing ahead into the tragedy of willfully choosing to keep the cultural dimmer set on low. If our aim is to extract as much financial gain as we can from our culture, then let’s just say so. Far better an honest turning away from the vibrancy of culture than a high-minded pretense backed by patently false syllogisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s got a new video out describing how Microsoft Sharepoint is useful.  I&#39;m kinda forced into using Sharepoint at the day job so this helped me a lot.  It&#39;ll calm me down when I can&#39;t get the blog to work like Wordpress, or the document libraries to work like Stellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a huge fan of Dan Roam and the visual thinking techniques he taught in his book &amp;quot;The Back of the Napkin&amp;quot;. I&#39;ve used his techniques in several of my own presentations with very good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan&#39;s built a four part presentation explaining the current debate on health care reform that is really easy to understand. It&#39;s well worth a couple minutes to view, especially if you subscribe to any US news channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken around 7:30AM. The clouds are low in the mountains because it&#39;s&lt;br&gt;
seriously humid here (north of Nelson BC). It gets hot during the day&lt;br&gt;
then big thunderstorms in the afternoon. Expecting the same today.&lt;br&gt;
So we get lots of greenery - it&#39;s a completely different ecosystem&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re up at the top of the Lake Louise gondola, looking back at the&lt;br&gt;
lake, chateau and glacier. The sky has quite a bit of smoke haze,&lt;br&gt;
which I assume is from the wildfires in the Okanagan valley, 600km to&lt;br&gt;
the west.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m shocked by the size of the glaciers. It&#39;s been 8 years since I&#39;ve&lt;br&gt;
been here and to my mind the glaciers are way smaller than the last&lt;br&gt;
time we were here. And not just Lake Louise - all over. Climate&lt;br&gt;
change in action, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just can&#39;t ignore customer service issues and hide behind policies anymore. Especially if you tick off a guy with talent. 2.7M views and counting. Bet United&#39;s glad it saved a couple dollars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pal Darwin Janz reminded me of a great presentation from Michael Wesch on how YouTube changed everything. Well worth your time to check it out. Then start posting some vids, pictures or writing....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seth shares a great example of how powerpoint doesn&#39;t cut it anymore -- video is the way to go. It&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s simple, and it makes an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullet points are long gone from my presentations, but maybe it&#39;s time to kill the presentation outright. Why tell people when you can show them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m rereading &amp;quot;Brilliant Orange&amp;quot;, an outstanding history of Dutch football in the context of their culture, art, architecture and landscape. The author, David Winner, makes the connection between the best Dutch footballer&#39;s ability to create space on the pitch with the Dutch abiity to literally create a country out of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast land creation by dike and canal building makes for a flat and uniform landscape. One that, in my imagination anyway, seems a lot like the prairie landscape in southern Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of this on the drive to Saskatoon yesterday when I saw this view. Great light, dark clouds and the bright yellow canola fields.  An amazing view, but quite common around here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Web Ink Now: Social Media is the new punk rock</title>

&lt;p&gt;Interesting analogy. I missed the rise of punk -- was old enough but didn&#39;t really get it. But I&#39;ve been searching for the same passion and participation ever since and I&#39;m finding it in online communities. So I think the videographer is on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[not sure how posterous links work, but I found out about the video from David Meerman Scott&#39;s awesome Web Ink Now blog. I hope this links through!]&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Buried Trolley Line on Albert Street</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/buried-trolley-line-on-albert-street/"/>
		<updated>2009-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;m leaving this here as a reminder of the single biggest mistakes I&#39;ve made as a blogger -- relying on a third party service to post to my blog.  I used a service called Posterous for quite a while and when they went under, I saved my posts but didn&#39;t save the images.  So you can&#39;t see this photo of Albert Street and I don&#39;t have it anywhere.  Sigh. The tracks have been paved over too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took this photo while walking to work last week -- it&#39;s a bit of urban archeology as a City work crew (who is re-paving Albert Street Bridge) uncovered the old trolley lines that used to run the length of Albert Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they proceeded to cut them out and continue repaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad in a way.  It made me think about what Regina would be like if it was still compact enough to support a trolley line.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever one of the kids is listening to &#39;classic rock&#39; on CD I think back to a great CBC radio show called The Great Eastern. Billed as &amp;quot;Newfoundland&#39;s Cultural Magazine&amp;quot;, it was a stunning window into the culture and lifestyles of our newest province. The show ran from 1994-1999 and I absolutely loved it when it was on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Internet, my iPod, and a fellow I only know as gporter, I&#39;m reliving this funny part of my life through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gporter.net/great/index.php&quot;&gt;Great Eastern archives.&lt;/a&gt; All the old episodes are there along with show notes, music playlists and other extras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m listening to season 2 now but still haven&#39;t found the part with the classic rock on CD collection. It&#39;s from the end of one show where the host, Paul Moth, is comparing bland new digital recordings with the full bodied expression of an LP on coal-fired radio, using Led Zepplin&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Whole Lotta Love.&lt;/em&gt; Good times, good times...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you gporter, whoever you are...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I need to start watching more Charlie Rose</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/i-need-to-start-watching-more-charlie-rose/"/>
		<updated>2009-04-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/i-need-to-start-watching-more-charlie-rose/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really watch much TV and I watch even less current affairs but lately I keep been pointing me to the Charlie Rose show.   Now there&#39;s a fellow who understands how the Web works.  Or at least he seems extremely interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Mitch Joel&lt;/a&gt; is really digging into how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/trying-to-outgoogle-google/&quot;&gt;traditional print media is dying&lt;/a&gt; due to the changes brought about by the Web.  He pointed me to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlierose.com/view/content/10208&quot;&gt;Charlie Rose episode&lt;/a&gt; with the CEO of the Associated Press and Arianna Huffington, where they describe to wildy different futures for journalism and aggregators of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite Charlie Rose episode is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlierose.com/view/content/10093&quot;&gt;interview with Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; that aired in February.  It&#39;s a rapid fire hour where Marc talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/where-its-at-and-where-its-going-according-to-marc-andreessen/&quot;&gt;where the Web is at and where it&#39;s going&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mitch Joel for pointing me to the Andreeson interview too.  Maybe if you don&#39;t have time to watch Charlie Rose, you should just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/blog/&quot;&gt;go read Mitch&#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.  He&#39;ll let you know the best stuff to watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Damn! I can&#39;t get any consistency with the embedded video. Sorry about that. Check the link to the Charlie Rose site for a larger view]&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Siting a School in a Sausage</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/siting-a-school-in-a-sausage/"/>
		<updated>2009-04-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/siting-a-school-in-a-sausage/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a lesson about how Collaboration, Consultation and Compromise might not, in the end, come up with the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic:  We&#39;re building a new school in our neighbourhood.  Not to accomodate an influx of new kids, but to cope with the long slow decline in enrollment in the neighbourhood.   Three existing schools serving just over 500 kids [pre-K - grade 8] today and projecting out to just over 400 kids in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good News:  We&#39;re getting a new school!  One that will reflect all the best things in new teaching methods and a greater range of learning patterns.  A school built to bring out the very best in all our kids.  One that will set them up well to live and work in the new Creative Age.   Very rare to do this in an older neighbourhood and almost unheard of in Regina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad News #1:  Complete lack of agreement on what &#39;Big&#39; or &#39;Small&#39; is with respect to school size or what&#39;s the optimal size for new &#39;team teaching&#39; methods.  Instead, we&#39;re bound to an arbitrary number of 200 kids as a minimum number for a school.   The result:  We&#39;re not combining three schools into one, but instead three schools into two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad News #2:  The two schools we&#39;re combining are at the edges of the neighbourhood.    We need to pick one of the existing sites for the new school.  The end result is a serving area that looks like a big sausage with a school at one end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad News #3.  Because we&#39;re only building a school for 225 kids, we&#39;re not building a &#39;full size&#39; school.  We&#39;re getting a small (class C) gymnasium.  We get the bare minimum of project rooms and no specific project rooms for things like music, dance or the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re really setting ourselves up for a problem in the future.   Even if you believe that 250 kids is an optimal school size and 200 is a minimum cut off  (and I&#39;m convinced that&#39;s still too small), the numbers just don&#39;t add up well for two schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Case: 8 years from now we&#39;ll have two schools just barely above the minimum cut off (203 kids per school.)  Each school has their nose just barely above water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse Case:  One school is well above the cut (300 kids) and this school is overcrowded.  The other school is well below the cut (100 kids) and is on the list for closure.  It makes no difference which school is big or small here.  Either there are too many kids packed into a very old school or we built the new school way too small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, there&#39;s an easy way to fix this -- combine all three schools now and put a new school in the centre of the neighbourhood.     The school is built big enough from the start, with a full slate of features.  400 students is still not a Big School, even in Saskatchewan (Warman, SK for example is dealing with schools that can&#39;t even hold all their kids.  500 kids from K-5 means grade 6-8 are in the high school.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s getting to the point of groupthink.  The best ideas of individuals are combined to do a dumb thing, but we can all say we collaborated in the process.  And $15 million down the tube building something that will be either way too big or way too small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I try to do in all my work is to take a new approach or a fresh angle at solving an old problem.  Whether it&#39;s transforming my &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcaregina.ca&quot;&gt;community association&lt;/a&gt; to be more about looking out than looking inward, or bringing brand new bread to my neighbourhood, or even a new style of presentations to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://sasktel.com&quot;&gt;day job&lt;/a&gt;, I want to Wow people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Nulman is a man who has indirectly guided me along this journey.  He&#39;s the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://powrightbetweentheeyes.typepad.com&quot;&gt;one of my favourite blogs&lt;/a&gt; and has just finished a new book called POW! -- Profiting from the Power of Surprise.  It&#39;s a book I&#39;ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of his book launch, Andy&#39;s giving away 200 copies of his new book to bloggers who &lt;a href=&quot;http://powrightbetweentheeyes.typepad.com/pow_right_between_the_eye/2009/01/200-free-pow-booksan-offer-you-cant-refuse.html&quot;&gt;link back to his site.&lt;/a&gt;  I&#39;d gladly &lt;a href=&quot;http://andynulman.com&quot;&gt;link back&lt;/a&gt; for free, but just in case, here&#39;s my address Andy  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I must have been abducted by aliens and had my memory wiped out since I completely forgot to tell you all about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/TribesQA&quot;&gt;Tribes Q&amp;amp;A ebook&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s another collaboration from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; tribe of followers -- some of the nicest, smartest and most creative people I&#39;ve ever met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ebook answers some of the questions that seem to come up when people try to apply Seth&#39;s ideas about forming and leading tribes.   I could go on, but fellow triiibster &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/PaulOnStage&quot;&gt;Paul Durban&lt;/a&gt; is a genius at expressing ideas through pictures, so let&#39;s have Paul explain it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Who is your strategy document for?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/"/>
		<updated>2008-11-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nBdyFBOa5t-374.avif 374w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nBdyFBOa5t-374.webp 374w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nBdyFBOa5t-374.jpeg 374w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/nBdyFBOa5t-374.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;374&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;statue of Moses with the stone tablets&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a leader within a large organization, sooner or later you&#39;ll need to develop a strategy -- recommendations on how to respond to an event or take advantage of a change in the world. You&#39;ll do some research, talk to people and think a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the vision is clear in your head, typically the next step is to get everything down on paper so your strategy can get vetted, approved and implemented. Here&#39;s where everything slide sideways quicker than a Texas driver in an ice storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-size-does-not-fit-all&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;One Size Does Not Fit All &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to remember that a LOT of people need to know about your idea, from the top executive to the worker who will eventually implement your vision. And they need to be treated differently. &amp;quot;Maximize shareholder value&amp;quot; might have meaning for the CEO but it sure sounds like vapour to someone who is working with customers all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-everyone-loves-a-story&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;But Everyone Loves a Story &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execs may claim to be all about the numbers, but they still need to get some emotional attachment before your big idea will really resonate. Storytelling, examples, pictures, colour all help spread your idea and make it stick with people, no matter who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-should-i-write&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;So what should I write? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your idea is important, and it needs to spread, then you&#39;re going to have to spread your idea many ways. Time to get over the false hope that a single document will inspire everyone in your company to see the light. Here&#39;s some ideas on how to get different audiences to respond to your strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can&#39;t avoid the standard documents:&lt;/strong&gt; Execs probably require standard documents like business cases, standard item descriptions and presentation layouts. They&#39;re not fun but they&#39;re required. Do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it fun and make it real:&lt;/strong&gt; Leave the business case in your desk and take a strong presentation on the road to talk to workgroups. Lots of colour, pictures, stories and a strong image of the future. You&#39;ll gain credibility and some allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give them something to share:&lt;/strong&gt; An entertaining ebook that describes your vision and the journey to achieve it is a great giveaway to help your allies spread the word for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-s-worth-it&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;It&#39;s worth it! &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/who-is-your-strategy-document-for/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it&#39;s a lot of work building a collection of documents and presentations to get your ideas across to a variety of audiences. But it&#39;s a really big idea, right? Right? If it&#39;s not worth the effort then you&#39;re better off stepping back to the research / talking / thinking phase.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dq9MVrLOhF-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dq9MVrLOhF-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dq9MVrLOhF-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/dq9MVrLOhF-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;a very poor, unreadable powerpoint slide&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, about 150 corporate marketers trudged five blocks to the local hotel, went into the dull beige ballroom and sat in row upon row of hardback chairs for another &amp;quot;quarterly rollout.&amp;quot; We started with &amp;quot;the numbers&amp;quot; (three charts, small font) then list after list of what we did and what we&#39;re doing next quarter. The call for &#39;any questions?&#39; was met with silent stares. 90 minutes later we stood up, stretched, and trudged back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that all there is? You get 150 people in a room to bore them to death? Honestly, a single slide with a picture, or colour even, would&#39;ve knocked people out of their chairs. In this case, the only leaning forward was to look at a blackberry email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so frustrating when people blow wonderful opportunities to inspire, delight and energize. Boring 150 people at a time is criminal, but how often do we do this in our small groups too? How many of your community meetings just drone on through the same agenda month after month? How many of us, in an attempt to include everyone, talk to noone in particular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do this, even a little, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://presentationzen.com/&quot;&gt;get help with your presentations.&lt;/a&gt; There are lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://slideshare.com/&quot;&gt;good presentation examples&lt;/a&gt; available.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Worried about sharing your cool idea?  Try a FriendDA.</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/worried-about-sharing-your-cool-idea-try-a-friendda/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A recurring Triiibes mantra is &amp;quot;Ideas that Spread, Win.&amp;quot;  In fact, having a good idea spread is &lt;strong&gt;more important than getting credit for it.&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s a tough one for me, as much of my professional life is making darn sure my company&#39;s secrets stay in the company and I&#39;m afraid that attitude has leaked into my personal life too.   So I&#39;ve been on a personal journey to share more ideas, more often, to more people.   Yet, it&#39;s still a struggle, especially when it comes to new business ideas, like my bakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this made me very receptive to the ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/10/19/friendda.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randsinrepose.com/&quot;&gt;Rands in Repose&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the top half of my &#39;must read&#39; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Rands comes up with an elegant, and possibly tongue in cheek, way to pitch your next great idea to a friend to get some feedback. It&#39;s for those really good &#39;uns -- the Next Big Thing that you Actually Might Implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in a 12 step program to help me freely share ideas, but what about you? Are you the type of person who worries about other people stealing your ideas? Then maybe a FriendDA is the tool you need!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Must See video if we&#39;re going to get along.</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-must-see-video-if-we-re-going-to-get-along/"/>
		<updated>2008-11-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-must-see-video-if-we-re-going-to-get-along/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since August, I&#39;ve been part of an online group of writers, marketers, thinkers and leaders led by Seth Godin. It&#39;s called Triiibes.com but it&#39;s closed to new members*, so no sense going there right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion on Triiibes lately has been the US presidential election. It&#39;s easy enough to see why -- it&#39;s on a lot of people&#39;s minds these days. But there hasn&#39;t been any more common ground found in this group than with any other group of people I&#39;ve talked with during this, or any other election season. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a short video by Jonathan Haidt** that puts a lot of the election discussion into context. In the entertaining and ultimately hopeful presentation, he talks about morals as the reason for this polarity, and offers up ideas to find common ground even with moral differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html&quot;&gt;Video Link: Jonathan Haidt on the Moral Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a look, then let&#39;s discuss. I&#39;ll wait for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* If you&#39;re completely miffed that you can&#39;t get into triiibes, there is a way. But I need to know you&#39;re serious about it before I&#39;ll tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Mr. Haidt is the author of one of my all time favorite books &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1222267547&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;The Happiness Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; which is the one book on psychology that you simply must go read. But wait till we talk about the video.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Putting the Tribes idea to work for non-profits</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/putting-the-tribes-idea-to-work-for-non-profits/"/>
		<updated>2008-11-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/putting-the-tribes-idea-to-work-for-non-profits/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I put &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/09/non-profit-riff.html&quot;&gt;Seth&#39;s conference call for non-profits&lt;/a&gt; on my iPod a couple weeks ago and have listened to it four times so far. I guess I&#39;m one of those auditory learners because Seth&#39;s talk really resonated with me. I tossed and turned all night thinking about how to best apply these ideas to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcaregina.ca/&quot;&gt;local community association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background: We&#39;re the stereotypical old, boring organization who runs some kids recreational programs, tries to start a few more now and then, installs some new playground equipment every 5 years or so, and bemoans the loss of volunteer spirit in the community (reality is lots of people volunteer, just not with us anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to get more action / buzz / excitement going about the work we do. New website, more focus on the neighbourhood at large rather than the association, although my email updates have had a healthy dose of &#39;we need volunteers&#39; in them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth&#39;s talk got me thinking of how we need to change.  Here are some initial thoughts, in the hope they might kickstart your own ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Be clear on what we want to accomplish. More community programs? More connection between neighbours? There need to be causes before there can be tribes, and we might be nurturing different tribes for each cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Make it easy for people to connect with each other around these causes -- more than connecting with the association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Make it even easier for people to tell others about their cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Make it easy for people to support the cause by doing what they already do. (ie. building a squidoo lens about their hobby can still help the cause.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-how-should-i-change-my-approach&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how should I change my approach?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/putting-the-tribes-idea-to-work-for-non-profits/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, shifting away from regular &#39;Next Meeting&#39; emails is one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on getting our most active members (those who are enrolled in lots of programs) spreading the word about our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get those who are most visible in the neighbourhood spreading the word about the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We become &amp;quot;the platform&amp;quot;, but really more of the guide for easy ways to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collect permission assets along the way, with the intent of connecting people to start new projects (that they design) Maybe we don&#39;t start projects but guide people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrate the heck out of everything the tribe does -- not what the association does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is what Seth calls &amp;quot;organizing around a tribe&amp;quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1225482044&amp;amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;his new book.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-am-i-missing&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What am I missing? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/putting-the-tribes-idea-to-work-for-non-profits/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

		<title>Examples of Tribes:  The Tribes Case Study Ebook</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/examples-of-tribes-the-tribes-case-study-ebook/"/>
		<updated>2008-10-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/examples-of-tribes-the-tribes-case-study-ebook/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marketing guru &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; has launched a new book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1225482044&amp;amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;Tribes: We Need You To Lead Us&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll be posting a review shortly, because it truly is an amazing book about a very powerful idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tribes&amp;quot; is the term Seth uses to describe groups of people who form around an idea and a leader.   It has huge implications for marketers, since it changes the approach about marketing your product or service or idea.  Instead of making sure Everyone knows about your idea, Seth asserts it&#39;s more important that you reach out to those people who are passionate about your idea, give them the platform to let your idea spread and &lt;strong&gt;lead them along the journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tougher for me to explain the concept than it is to share examples.  I figure Seth anticipated that, since he organized his own tribe (including me) to build an &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/free-tribes-ebo.html&quot;&gt;ebook with tribal examples&lt;/a&gt;.   There are nearly two hundred cases in the book, including a short one about my favorite fantasy football website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.footballguys.com/&quot;&gt;footballguys.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Go check it out, or download it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/examples-of-tribes-the-tribes-case-study-ebook/%22currenttribescasebook.pdf%22&quot;&gt;currenttribescasebook.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you&#39;re at it, make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;sign up for updates&lt;/a&gt; on Seth&#39;s site.  It&#39;s my favorite blog in the world, daily inspiration, observation and marketing leadership.  Seth knows what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Manifesto on Forming and Leading Tribes</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/manifesto-on-forming-and-leading-tribes/"/>
		<updated>2008-09-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/manifesto-on-forming-and-leading-tribes/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Great day today as it marks the release of a new manifesto from the idea spreading guru &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://changethis.com/50.01.Tribes&quot;&gt;forming and leading tribes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth&#39;s all about spreading ideas and has written at length about getting remarkable ideas to spread.  The concept of tribes expands on this -- it&#39;s about creating a platform so it&#39;s easy for people (your tribe) to spread your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time this summer working on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcaregina.ca&quot;&gt;local community association&lt;/a&gt; website and have been trying to embrace the tribe idea.  But I&#39;ll leave that for another post.  For now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://changethis.com/50.01.Tribes&quot;&gt;download Seth&#39;s ebook&lt;/a&gt; , give it 3 or 4 good reads and tell me what you think in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Making the S+S Case to Small Business IT Providers</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/making-the-s-s-case-to-small-business-it-providers/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/making-the-s-s-case-to-small-business-it-providers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference was in helping partners make the transition to a Software Plus Services world. Microsoft has recently announced that they are offering a series of email, collaboration and productivity tools in an online, hosted model. If you&#39;re an IT Services company who is used to selling and supporting onsite licenses, this could be seen as a Very Big Threat to your business model and livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Microsoft&#39;s value proposition for Partners, in case you&#39;re talking to an IT firm who is feeling a little nervous these days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most customers would rather lose voice service than email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty bold statement there and I just wish my pen was faster, as I missed the specific statistic. But it was &#39;lots&#39; for sure. The premise is that more and more business is done via email today -- so much so that email is the essential service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Providers would rather not have to repair on-premise Exchange servers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic goes like this: If you signed on as the service provider for a small business email system, and email is more important (or at least, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; important) than voice, do you really deal with outages with a single-server, on-premise email solution? Fixing customer outages is not the path to loyalty no matter how good you are. Preventing outages is where it&#39;s at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring revenue streams are a Very Good Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos love them. So does Microsoft. Now IT partners can benefit from the peace of mind that recurring revenue streams bring. As one partner said, once your contracted, recurring revenue stream exceeds your overhead, it&#39;s very easy to sleep at night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers are interested in Software + Services models, if it&#39;s from their local, trusted partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft cited that 70% of SMB customers are interested in S+S. They see an opportunity to free up staff and avoid capital investments. They are especially interested in hearing about S+S from their existing IT service provider partners. Small business trust solutions coming from their local partners -- more so than offers from large corporations like IBM or Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most S+S customers are new to the VAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software + Services provides a solution for the customers who have said No to on-premise solutions. This grows the VAR&#39;s customer base and revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VAR&#39;s can move up-market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VAR who is too small to support a 200 seat on-premise solution may be &#39;just right&#39; to support a 200 seat S+S solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;+ Services&amp;quot; part of the equation is all revenue for the VAR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is clear that there is a difference between S+S and SaaS. They look at partners to deliver the value-added services such as directory integration, application integration, training and end-user support. They see the Services work to be worth several multiples of the Software fees -- anywhere from 2X to 7X depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly aligns with our conversations with TriCon Technical Services. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this aligns with our IT Service Provider interviews later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does SaskTel fit in the value chain with Microsoft, IT Services companies and small businesses? More thoughts on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing #3:  Solution Selling</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-3-solution-selling/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-3-solution-selling/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article is the third from a series of excellent presentations from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; in Iowa, which were presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://partner.microsoft.com/Canada/trainingevents/wwpartnerconference&quot;&gt;Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland CEO Arlin Sorenson gave an excellent presentation on their Solution Selling process which he claims made the difference in growing his business. When you consider he started from his corn farm in Iowa, with 25,000 people in a 30 mile radius, and is now an $18M business with 80 employees in 8 locations, it&#39;s worth hearing how he grew his business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, a couple key assumptions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sales process doesn&#39;t have to be the same as Heartland&#39;s, so long as it matches your products, your customers, and is &lt;em&gt;consistent!&lt;/em&gt; Follow the process every single time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales process is really designed by Marketing. There are tools / materials developed by Marketing that are key to the process. Marketing designs the process, Sales executes the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent processes become necessary once a company grows to a certain size. Prior to that, referrals or independent sales/marketing/engineering effort may be enough. But sooner or later, you need a process to coordinate these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartland&#39;s Sales Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing. The Marketing activities which I described in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; are all designed to drive leads to Sales. The goal is NOT to automatically sell a product. Instead the goal is to gain an appointment with the prospect to begin the next step in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaway: Their systems are set up so that every lead moving to the next step is tracked to a specific marketing activity. Was it a seminar? The third direct mail piece? It&#39;s important to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment. Heartland takes each prospect through a formal assessment process which both uncovers customer pain points and value (in the customer&#39;s words) but gives Heartland the chance to &lt;strong&gt;create customer value from within the sales process&lt;/strong&gt;. They accomplish this by creating a three year technology plan based upon the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Heartland has begun to charge prospects for the assessment and technology plan. This emphasizes the value in the deliverable and prevents customers shopping Heartland&#39;s plan to competitors. The cost of the assessment is rebated back if the prospect purchases services from HTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://partnersalesresources.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Partner Portal&lt;/a&gt; has several sample assessment tools partners can use or modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal: This step generates a formal quote for services based upon the three year technology plan developed in the Assessment phase. The goal here is an accurate quote delivered quickly, in order to reinforce Heartland as a Business Partner, with the distributor relationships required to get the whole job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated deliverable given the large number of distributors and partners Heartland works with. They use tools like QuoteWerks and Infopath to pull from distributor price lists and integrate directly into Heartland&#39;s CRM and ERP systems. I was amazed at the level of integration they have in place today compared to what we do at SaskTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation: Of course, you have to actually do the work. Most companies stop here but there&#39;s still more to be done before the sales process is complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell the Story: This is one of the most powerful steps in the process, because real evidence of a job well done feeds the Marketing effort at the top of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland ensures that every solution over $2500 gets a &#39;Customer Win Wire&#39; -- a one page case study / press release which describes the customer pain, the solution and the business value. It also promotes the partners which were used to solve the customer problem. They are written by Sales using a consistent template developed by Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arlin mentioned that Sales hates writing the Win Wires but &amp;quot;compensation drives behaviour.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Peer Groups, and some final thoughts on what SaskTel can do with these examples.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing #2:   Drip Irrigation</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; shared what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; is doing in the area of event marketing, but that&#39;s not all they do. They have a tried and true direct marketing strategy as well. During his Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference seminar, Heartlands Sales and Marketing VP Larry Hedin shared their top performing direct marketing tactics. Larry calls it &#39;drip marketing.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Deliver a series of oversized &amp;quot;Impact&amp;quot; postcards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; alt=&quot;HTS Impact Postcard&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS Impact Postcard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland&#39;s mail campaigns are designed as a series to drive home a specific message (ie. the case for disaster recovery services.) The sales force performs follow-up calls after the third mailing with the goal of setting up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: Create a monthly e-newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; alt=&quot;HTS e-Newsletter&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS e-Newsletter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTS used to do a print newsletter but they soon realized they were spending more money and receiving less information from their customers. They use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constantcontact.com/&quot;&gt;Constant Contact&lt;/a&gt;, an online newsletter management service, to deliver a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/Newsletters/HTSNewsletters/May08_Company.htm&quot;&gt;monthly e-newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and to track open rates and click throughs by topic. That way, they know which prospects are interested and the topics in which they are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry was clear that the purpose of the newsletter was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to sell HTS services. It was to educate and inform prospects, and to get the prospects to take action by clicking through to the HTS website. Each newsletter is built around a topic of current interest, like disaster recovery during tornado season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-newsletter generates real sales results. For example, Heartland sold a Voip phone system to a local school based on a school administrator reading a Voip article in an HTS newsletter. This $70,000 sale has grown into other opportunities in other offices under the school&#39;s control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, over 1300 people are signed up to this free monthly newsletter. Their newsletter is so popular that HTS is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/ymt/enewsletters.htm&quot;&gt;rebranding their newsletter for over 200 other IT services partners&lt;/a&gt; around the country. While intended for marketing Heartland&#39;s core services, the e-newsletter has created an entirely new line of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Up: Solution Selling -- a formal sales process gets results!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing: Will it Work in Wheat Fields?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; is an IT services provider in who take an aggressive approach to marketing to small businesses. It&#39;s been effective -- from their headquarters on a farm in a corn field in Iowa they have grown to 8 locations, 81 employees and $18M in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href=&quot;https://partner.microsoft.com/Canada/trainingevents/wwpartnerconference&quot;&gt;Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in July&lt;/a&gt;, I attended a presentation by their VP of Sales and Marketing, Larry Hedin, where he discussed marketing ideas that work for Heartland. Much of what they do leverage marketing development funds (MDF) from their various hardware and software partners. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Hold Microsoft Across America Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Across America van&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Across America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has seven large trailers which are filled with technology displays, which travel the country spreading the word about Microsoft. The trailers carry everything from digital home to enterprise servers. HTS works with local Chambers of Commerce and colleges to drive attendance to the events, which are often aligned with other activities (football games, fairs, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, HTS has run 13 events with 100 attendees each. Lest you think this is just &#39;awareness&#39;, Larry said each event also adds $100K to their sales pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: Hold Seminars in Cooperation with Vendors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry has leveraged partner MDF funds and vendor field sales teams to hold a series of educational events, all under the HTS banner. These include one day seminars, lunch and learn sessions and webinars. Larry said the key was to have the vendors attend both for technical expertise but also to see the energy and interest in the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3: Run Office Technology Makeover Contests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; alt=&quot;HTS advert&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS advert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is the one that&#39;s going to pay for my conference. &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s pure gold.&lt;/strong&gt; What HTS has done is run an annual $25,000 Technology Makeover contest, where local businesses write in to explain how a technology makeover will transform their business. The local Chamber of Commerce promoted the event over the three months that applications were accepted and the local media picked up the story too. The only restriction to applying? Your business had to have less than 50 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four finalists and eventual winner are announced on the local news (again, in conjuntion with another newsworthy event like the Microsoft Across America van or state fair.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;301&quot; alt=&quot;HTS winner announced&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS winner announced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, the winner was a local chocolate shop, who received network equipment, wiring, notebooks and three months Managed Services from HTS. All the vendors turned out for photos on &amp;quot;Makeover Day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; alt=&quot;HTS makeover install&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS makeover install&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the gold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every application is a qualified lead! Customers write, in detail, exactly why they would value these technologies and services. HTS is averaging $250,000 in the sales pipeline with each event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of HTS managed services, all the equipment is donated by the vendors, using partner marketing development funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of promotion costs is covered by the Chamber of Commerce and the story is seen as newsworthy by the local media. Promotion is organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, the program is nearly free and results in the best possible qualified leads for the HTS sales force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry shared many more sales and marketing ideas which I&#39;ll share with you in future posts, but their event marketing efforts are really taking off. They are getting customers excited about possibilities and are leveraging partner marketing funds to the hilt. As their CEO Arlin Stephenson says, &amp;quot;Over $1 billion of partner marketing funds goes unclaimed every year.&amp;quot; Claim it, get creative and grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTS serves a market very similar to SaskTel -- smaller cities and a rural economy. How can these ideas translate to our market, our customers and our partners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s my birthday!  Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although birthdays are kinda quiet around here they&#39;re still very special and today was a great day.   Up early to watch Ben play soccer, then off for a light lunch with Cindy (hot dogs at the Peavey Mart and Milky Way ice cream), then watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/&quot;&gt;Euro 2008 final&lt;/a&gt; before joining up with the kids and Cindy&#39;s family for a movie (&lt;a href=&quot;http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/wall-e/&quot;&gt;Wall-E&lt;/a&gt;) and finally homemade bbq burgers.  And I got some community association work done, some wood chopped for tomorrow&#39;s pizza party and some dough mixed.  Not bad for a Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birthday gift this year was the best ever.  Cindy signed the two of us up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mssociety.ca/sask/bike_waskesiu.htm&quot;&gt;MS-Bike Tour&lt;/a&gt; this September in Waskiseu.  66km of hilly parkland and possibly bears.  Awesome!  The only problem is that neither of us has done much riding so far this year, so the training regimine starts, erm, tomorrow. But early tomorrow.   And I&#39;ll eat pizza standing up or something.  Tuesday for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribefire.com/&quot;&gt;ScribeFire&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin for Firefox which integrates my web surfing and blogging in a very easy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s integrated right into this blog, so when I see an interesting web page I can get an editor up and running without leaving the web page. I can format the post, assign categories and publish with one click. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some really neat integrations with popular social media sites so I can stumble, digg, etc all without leaving the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the picture on this post was inserted with ScribeFire. One button and I&#39;m searching Flickr or YouTube and inserting images and videos with a click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impression is that this is a way cool plugin. If you blog, it&#39;s a must-have!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>3 Game-changing ways to make this the Best Mothers Day Ever!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/3-game-changing-ways-to-make-this-the-best-mothers-day-ever/"/>
		<updated>2008-04-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/3-game-changing-ways-to-make-this-the-best-mothers-day-ever/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been cajoled into doing some fundraising for my son&#39;s Japanese exchange program. So this email went out to some work colleagues at noon today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for the cheesy Make Money Online website look. Close?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;========================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi and Happy Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sending this email to a small and select group of colleagues -- people who share a passion for good times, friendships, good health and great food. People who I&#39;ve really grown to love and respect over the years. But you are also friends who struggle at this time of year, and I can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; -- you&#39;re willing to go the extra mile for that special flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; -- you&#39;ll take the time to grow your own fruits and vegetables, or plant a tree for the shade, or plant some flowers for the simple beauty of the bloom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And fellas, if you&#39;re married, you &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; too -- you know that on Mother&#39;s Day the last thing she wants is to get corralled into the buffet line for an over priced &amp;quot;Thank You Mom&amp;quot; lunch buffet, with the full complement of screaming babies, whining toddlers and the mother-in-law. Noooo...thank &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; honey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you get it because, in this way, I&#39;m just like you. &lt;strong&gt;I love food.&lt;/strong&gt; Hell, I don&#39;t carry a purple daypack with &amp;quot;lunch&amp;quot; every day for 15 years by being indifferent to the stuff. And I don&#39;t take Cindy to brunch for Mothers Day either (anymore.) I&#39;ve found the secret to getting through the Hallmark Holiday season. &lt;strong&gt;I figured it out, and now I want to share my knowledge with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got three ways to make next weekend a Weekend to Remember!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: On Saturday May 10, on the eve of Mother&#39;s Day, there is an excellent steak night being held at Bonzzini&#39;s Brew Pub. For a mere $15 per ticket, you can enjoy a steak, potato, salad and a beer. Yes, you heard me right. A BEER! Steak and Beer for $15!! I didn&#39;t think it was possible anymore but the rising Canadian dollar has its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellas -- she wants to go. Your wife wants to go to this more than you know. She&#39;s complaining about the brunch thing to her girlfriends. She&#39;s moaning about your darling mother right now. She wants meat, potatoes and a beer. Really she does. She&#39;ll eat your salad, so don&#39;t worry about that part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies -- Guys are dim. He&#39;s not hearing your little hints. He&#39;s not comprehending &#39;the look.&#39; You need to buy the tickets, put them in his pocket and say &amp;quot;I want this for Mother&#39;s Day.&amp;quot; Make it really simple for him and get what you want!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single Folk -- why are you still reading this? It&#39;s Steak and Beer. It&#39;s Saturday. &#39;nuff said!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Mark! She&#39;s a vegetarian with a barley allergy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No problem. I&#39;m here for you. Besides, while the Steak Night will guarantee you a weekend to remember, it&#39;s a quick hit. Maybe your looking for something that lasts longer. A lot longer! I&#39;ve got special access to gift certificates from some of the best greenhouses, florists and garden centres in the Greater Regina Area to get you some slow-release love and affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 is from WP Gardens on Grant Road (by Tumblers) They&#39;ve got a wide selection of bedding plants and vegetables that will keep your yard and garden colourful and flavourful all summer long. The word on the street is WP has a cult following in SW Regina that is quite protective of their plants. The existing customers don&#39;t want to dilute the plant pool, but too bad! With these gift certificates you&#39;ve got the inside track to healthy eating, but for a short time (they have to be used by the end of June 2008) The gift certificates come in multiples of $20, and you get full face value of the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3 is from Unique Garden Centre / Unique Florists. The best selection of herbs, vegetables and bedding plants in the city. The best selection of trees and shrubs. Garden ornaments. Seeds. If you have Black Thumb instead of Green Thumb, you can get cut flowers from Unique Florists instead. And the GC&#39;s last till October. They&#39;ve got all your bases covered. Again, multiples of $20 and you get full face value!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face it -- cash is a lousy way to say &amp;quot;I Love You, Mom!&amp;quot; It&#39;s kinda cheesy, really. Now a gift certificate from a garden centre, maybe with an offer to, oh, drive her to the garden centre and now you&#39;re talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Mark! Is there a catch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No! No Catch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Yes. You see, Mothers Day is fast approaching. The time to act is now! Tickets are limited. The steak won&#39;t keep. The beer will evenutally get warm. It&#39;s time to start planting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the catch. You need to commit to purchase by Monday, May 5. It gives me time to get the right number of tickets / certificates and gives you the time to design the perfect moment to give the gift. So call me or email me [heck, or comment on this blog] but take action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, Mark. I&#39;m ready to Take Action. But why are you helping me like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy really. I care. I really do. I want you to give the best darn Mothers Day gift ever. I want you to enjoy lovely flowers all summer long. I want you to eat the best fruits and vegetables. I want to be your friend for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s something in it for me too. Proceeds for the steak and garden centre GC&#39;s go to the Regina Fujioka Student Exchange, which is hosting 25 Japanese students (age 11-12) this summer. My son Ben will be going to Japan in 2009 to complete the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this email. If so, it&#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hope you buy some tickets too. You get good food, Ben goes to Japan and I am still able to put food on my table. If so, it&#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;win-win-win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your friend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Well, I hope I&#39;ve done my job. I&#39;ve given you the three ways to make this the Best Mothers Day ever. You can change the game in your relationship with your mother, spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend. you can take it to a Whole. Other. Level. But are you willing to stop there? I know you all have other friends that are facing the same issues. The same challenges. The same stress over the Hallmark Holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are as caring and giving as I know you are, then &lt;strong&gt;forward this note with my blessing&lt;/strong&gt;. Share the joy. Build on the passion. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ARGH! I can&#39;t write anymore. I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s pissing me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s the return to corporate speak since baking school. Too many long, crappy, meaningless sentences which frustrate rather than educate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#39;m riding or out for a long walk the ideas flow easy. I can frame out four blog posts and three presentations while walking along Wascana Creek. But when I sit down to write it turns out as &amp;quot;bargle, bargle, bargle, blah, blah, blah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s hope, I think. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ittybiz.com/&quot;&gt;Naomi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://menwithpens.ca/&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; are helping me out. Go read their stuff. It&#39;s clear. It&#39;s direct. It&#39;s concise. And for someone with a blockage between brain and fingers, it&#39;s damned inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Figuring Out Flour</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/figuring-out-flour/"/>
		<updated>2008-03-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/figuring-out-flour/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/romanlily/694856387/&quot; title=&quot;photo sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/figuring-out-flour/images/694856387_12c02ac1b0_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/romanlily/694856387/&quot;&gt;June 30 (flour)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/people/romanlily/&quot;&gt;romanlily&lt;/a&gt; Since I got back from SFBI I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what to do with my flour. Around the time I switched to organic unbleached flour back in November I&#39;ve been struggling with pale loaves. We talked about this at school and I suspect that the organic flour might be the culprit. It all comes down to enzyme activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* enzymes (specifically, amalyse) breaks down the starch in flour into simple sugars. * the simple sugars are needed for yeast food, but left over sugars are what causes nice browning. That is, browning is caramelized sugars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you need sufficient enzyme activity to create enough simple sugars to both feed the yeast and have enough left over for a brown crust. How do I know how much enzyme activity is in my flour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Millers use a measurement called the Falling Number to determine enzyme activity. * Basically, they make a flour and water slurry, put it in a tube, put a weight on the slurry, and wait for the weight to fall. Enzyme activity breaks down the flour which allows the weight to fall. * Bakers want a falling number between 250 and 300 seconds. * Conventional (non-organic) bread flour typically meets this falling number requirement, but my organic flour has a higher falling number -- closer to 350 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still with me? So my organic flour has a falling number that&#39;s too high, which means I don&#39;t have enough enzyme activity to create simple sugars for yeast food and also for browning. Well, why not? And why does my Robin Hood flour not have this issue? It comes down to grain storage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Enzyme activity increases as the wheat berries get close to sprouting. ie. moisture is introduced. * However, any grain farmer will tell you he wants dry grain in the bin so it doesn&#39;t spoil. * Millers are no different. They want nice dry, stable grain in the bin to grind flour from. * Conventional flour millers add a product called fungal amalyse to their flour after they grind it in order to introduce additional enzyme activity to the flour, while preserving nice dry stable grain in the bin. * Organic millers don&#39;t have this option, so it&#39;s up to the baker to do the correcting on his own. Usually this is accomplished by adding 0.5% - 1% malted barley flour to the white flour. Malted = sprouted = lots of enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So armed with this information, all I have to do is find me some malted barley flour and I can fix my pale loaf problem. BUT, do you think I can find malted barley flour locally? Not yet! I&#39;m afraid I will have to go back to conventional flour (and incur the wrath of my local organic miller) until I can find some malted barley flour in the city. sigh...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just got a comment from John Fagan at &lt;a href=&quot;http://growregina.ca/&quot; title=&quot;Grow Regina&quot;&gt;Grow Regina&lt;/a&gt; -- they&#39;re taking applications for community garden plots right now, so head over there and sign up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John mentioned that they have different sized plots this year, so you can put in a couple tomatoes or 500 hills of potatoes, whatever gives your green thumb some pleasure!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s reason enough for me to add them to the &#39;lots o&#39; links&#39; section in the sidebar too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt; Well, the SFBI Whole Grain course is over and I&#39;m back in snowy Regina. It&#39;s great to be home but I&#39;m fighting as hard as I can to keep the bread vibe alive. It&#39;ll be hard to do that from my cubicle at work but I&#39;m more determined than ever to get our shop opened up sooner rather than later. In fact, I&#39;m meeting with a local SFBI grad tomorrow to keep the process going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great big Thank You to Michel, Evelyne, Erin, Laura, Marty, Shari, Jorge and everyone else at SFBI and TMB Baking. You made my three weeks one of the best learning experiences I&#39;ve ever had. And of course, a very special Thank You to Steve Issac and Didier Rosada, two world class bakers who shared so much knowledge about every facet of the baking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- the picture is a display of all the bread we baked during the Whole Grain course. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree that there was a huge variety to bake, eat and experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back to the land of ice and snow and honestly, I&#39;m very glad to be home. Three weeks is a long time to be away from my family and friends, even when I&#39;m having the time of my life baking every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Whole Grain and Specialty Flour course at the San Francisco Baking Institute was an excellent end to my adventure. If Artisan 1 was elementary school, and Artisan 2 was high school, then the Whole Grain course was bread university! We had a new instructor (Didier Rosada, a world renowned baker and teacher) and for the most part a new group of students as well. Many more professional bakers in this course so we dove straight into advanced mixing and shaping techniques. The teamwork was excellent so we got a lot done each day without getting all stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo represents all the bread we made during the week. From a simple Wheat Germ Baguette, to alternate grains like Corn Bread, Millet Bread and Spelt Bread, to interesting combinations like Buckwheat Pear Bread, Carrot Rolls and Roasted Pecan and Flax bread, to wild shapes like Sesame Flame and Crown of the Great Valley. My head was spinning with all the formulas, shapes and scoring patterns, but I took excellent notes and will be sharing these loaves with you over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I want to get back to baking in Regina, we&#39;re going to take one more week to stockpile some wood, get some supplies (including a bench that&#39;s at the correct working height) and slowly bring the oven up to temperature. It&#39;ll take some TLC to bring the oven out of its deep freeze without cracking the facade, but it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next email out will be a &#39;baking this week&#39; note, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an amazing day at the SFBI Whole Grains course. We combined more soakers, preferments and levains than I can count to come up with five complex loaves. The flavours and textures were as varied as the seeds that went in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what we made, from the back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prairie Bread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crown of the Great Valley (my favorite in taste and name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Castle Rye (#2 in both categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finnish Rye (the pun of the day, stated only 14 times was &amp;quot;The Finnish Rye is finished!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sesame Flame: winner of the shape of the week award.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some closeup shots in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/orangeboot/sets/72157603944031606/&quot;&gt;flickr group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final week at the San Francisco Baking Institute is underway and this week it&#39;s an advanced course on whole grains. There is a lot to learn and we&#39;re clipping along at a quick pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could summarize the course in two points it would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Grains do a job on the gluten structure of the bread, so you need to be careful to create a light, voluminous loaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: While people like the idea of whole grain bread, it is certainly an acquired taste, so we&#39;re learning ways to bring our guests on the journey a little at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and if I got a third point it would be this: there are more combinations of seeds, grains and fruits than I can possibly count! An eager baker can spend years tweaking formulae to come up with a unique, tasty combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the picture shows four of the five breads we made on Tuesday. From the left, they are Oatmeal Pan Bread, Flax Seed Bread, Millet Bread, and 100% Whole Wheat Bread. We also made a Corn Bread that is missing from the picture. Each uses different grains and seeds. Most use a preferment. Some use a preferment and a sourdough levain. Each has a unique shaping technique and scoring pattern. Honestly, I could spend years with this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we proceed down the whole grain path we&#39;re experimenting with countless combinations of soakers, levains and preferments. One bread we&#39;ll be making tomorrow uses four different pre-mixes before we make the final dough. Veterans of SFBI know that this means a desperate hunt for mixing bowls and containers to store it all. So far it&#39;s all working out pretty well -- no tub fights have been reported!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Do the Opposite</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/do-the-opposite/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_fGiRcaT3r-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_fGiRcaT3r-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_fGiRcaT3r-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_fGiRcaT3r-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;George in Seinfeld, doing the opposite&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the Seinfeld episode where George did the opposite of what he normally did and everything worked out well for him? That&#39;s a lot like the Whole Grain course at SFBI. We&#39;re getting the chance to learn from Didier Rosada, who is an exceptional baker and instructor. He&#39;s a very effective teacher and is helping me learn about a very complex topic. I&#39;m also picking up many tricks of the trade which will help me for years to come. But, many of his techniques are &amp;quot;the opposite&amp;quot; of what we learned in Artisan 1 and 2. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think we shouldn&#39;t add more water on Speed 2? Ha! Just slosh some more in there till it feels right! Really soft, that is. (It&#39;s called double hydration and makes for a very extensible, airy dough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 minutes on speed 2? No way, baby! Use colder water and mix like hell. At least this way I can pull a window. Heck, my dog could pull a window with this dough! (We&#39;re taking up to 8 minutes on speed 2 to develop the gluten and it&#39;s developed a lot more than Artisan 1, but we haven&#39;t over mixed one yet!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why put a little flour on the table when you can make it a solid mass of white? Go for it! (this highly hydrated, soft dough can get super sticky, so it needs a lot more flour for shaping and proofing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof baguettes seam down? Surely you jest! Seam up is the way to go. Then you can flip once on the peel and slide it onto the loader. All my baguettes were &#39;S&#39; shaped but it&#39;s a new technique so give it a try! (I got a tiny bit better on Day 2, but it&#39;s still a challenge)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 fingers between loaves? No Way! 3mm works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t move the loaf once it&#39;s scored? har har! Some of my loaves got moved at least three times. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t get moved to another oven. (in fairness, we&#39;re baking a lot of bread so we&#39;re really trying to be efficient with loader space)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a &#39;follow the directions&#39; type of guy this week is not for you. But if you want to see a different way which works very, very well, then seeing these new techniques is a real treat. I&#39;m having a ball so far -- it&#39;s already opened my eyes to new ways of doing things and new ways to view what we&#39;re doing when we&#39;re working with the dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I sure can&#39;t argue with the results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nGXBiJ0FDk-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nGXBiJ0FDk-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/nGXBiJ0FDk-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/nGXBiJ0FDk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;wheat germ baguette&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;wheat germ baguette&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wheat germ baguette -- all the best parts of a baguette with better nutrition and a nice wheaty taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/CaLP2vVq88-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/CaLP2vVq88-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;buckwheat pear&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;buckwheat pear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a buckwheat pear bread. The buckwheat adds colour and the pears and walnuts add a LOT of flavour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/DTKzPfUm9X-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/DTKzPfUm9X-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;semolina batard&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;semolina batard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a semolina batard with fennel and raisins. Very similar to what I make at home but with a much more delicate crust and crumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three outstanding loaves on the first day. Gotta love it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Regional Shapes</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6c9rxlRiSi-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/6c9rxlRiSi-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;regional bread shapes&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the Artisan II course on Friday by spending some time creating decorative bread shapes. Each shape represents a regional variety that is made in a specific French town. For example, you&#39;d find Pain d&#39;Aix in Aix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bread is a basic country bread with white and whole wheat flour, which tastes pretty good but seemed bland after the olive bread we baked in the morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s see if I can pick out the shapes from the picture. Starting at the top left corner and moving clockwise we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fendu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tordu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabatiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auvergnat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another Auvergnat with a smaller cap (how did two get in there?!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vivarais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charleston (a little lumpy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle is a Corrone Bordelais (my favorite) and the Pain d&#39;Aix, which looks kind of like a bowtie after some red wine. After white wine it looks like a moustache. Trust me on that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RfNMtuBvbo-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RfNMtuBvbo-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; alt=&quot;Mark at SFBI posing with some excellent bread&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone. It&#39;s another report from the road as I wrap up my second week at the San Francisco Baking Institute. The Artisan II course is called &amp;quot;Mastering Sourdough&amp;quot; but we did so much more as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bread in the picture is from Wednesday when we made four different sourdough loaves using different formulations. Just like the baguettes we made last week, the baker can make several adjustments to get different flavours from a sourdough loaf. He can use a liquid starter to get more lactic acid development for a yogurty, buttermilk-y sour taste. Or he can use a firm starter for more acetic acid development and a vinegary sour taste. Then he can adjust the number of times the starter is fed, and how much starter is put in the final dough, to manipulate the flavours even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? A wide variety. The loaves in the lower left are your classic San Francisco sourdough like you&#39;d get on Fisherman&#39;s Wharf. High acid content and a vinegar-sour flavour. The loaves closest to me have a much milder flavour and is closer to the mild sour taste I prefer. I&#39;ll make them both for you when I get home so you can tell me what you like best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t stop there, however. There was sourdough rye to make, sourdough whole wheat, and then some variations of regular yeasted dough like Ciabatta (I now know what an ultra-wet dough looks like), olive bread, walnut and raisin bread, and regional decorative breads. I can tell my Vivarais from my Auvergnat, but I can&#39;t always pronounce them properly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more week. Just one more week till I&#39;m back home and firing the oven again. But first I need a crash course in whole grains and specialty flours with guest instructor Didier Rosada. The word is that he&#39;s a Very Special Bread Instructor so I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting Didier and learning from him. I&#39;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- For those of you who can&#39;t get enough dough -- Daily updates from San Francisco are at my madbaker blog. More photos are &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/orangeboot/sets/72157603855278075/&quot;&gt;on flickr&lt;/a&gt;. Click the links for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s me looking tired and weak-armed, holding a massive boule I made to wrap up my second week at the San Francisco Baking Institute. I forgot to weigh it but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s 5kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loaf is made with a sourdough culture I started on Monday and was baked long to ensure the crumb is fully cooked. I love the dark colour -- it&#39;s hard to believe the loaf is made with white flour when it looks like that, but that&#39;s what caramelization does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really strange emotional vibe at school on Friday. I&#39;ve made some great new friends in the past two weeks and most of them are heading home now. It&#39;s tough to think about how I&#39;ll likely never see some of them again after getting along so well and having so much in common. It takes a certain type of person to bake bread, I guess, and I tend to click with that type of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&#39;m also wicked homesick, so my emotions are sure getting pulled in two directions. Time to hunker down, get some laundry done and push through the final week. I keep hearing that the new instructor is extremely good, so I&#39;m looking forward to the whole grain class, even as I&#39;m ready to hop on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&#39;s what a semolina loaf should look like. The formula is very similar to the bread we bake at the Orange Boot, and I got some pointers about shaping and applying sesame seeds which really helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bread was always tasty, but now it looks great too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! I now know what a wet dough really is. The verb we used to describe the dough as we were dividing the dough was &#39;swimming.&#39; And it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loaves in the pictures were massive, yet light as a feather. 10 inches square yet only weighed 600 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another neat technique I learned -- you need to dry these out in the oven a bit before unloading to drive out all the steam. Makes for a much crispier crust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man am I tired. It&#39;s been a long week so far but a pike of fun too. The loaves in the picture were made on Tuesday, for Day 2 of the Artisan 2 course. It was an interesting exercise since each shape contains a different sourdough starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The batards at the back contain a liquid levain (levain = sourdough starter.) The extra water in the levain results in more lactic acid development -- think yogurt or buttermilk sour as opposed to vinegar. -- and a light, gassy dough. I find the smell to be powerful but the resulting loaf to be very light and mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boules in row 3 contain a stiff sourdough levain, and 40% of the dough weight is made up of levain. The stiff levain causes more acetic acid development (ie. vinegar sour) but only adding 40% still gives a mild sour flavour in the final loaf. One note about the shape -- it&#39;s called a &amp;quot;chowder bowl&amp;quot; cut since the score line is a nice guide to cut off the lid and hollow the loaf out for a soup bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#39;bacillus&#39; loaves in the front right are made with the same stiff levain as the boules, but the dough contains 70% levain. This results in a much more sour loaf of the type that most people associate with San Francisco Sourdough. Its not my favorite -- I prefer a milder sour taste -- but it&#39;s certainly true to the loaf&#39;s intent. Quite tasty. The scoring is a really attractive &#39;S&#39; cut with big ears. My scoring technique was going really well with that batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the loaves in the front left are also made with a stiff levain, but the levain is only fed once per day (the other is fed twice per day.) The resulting loaf is the most acedic of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting experiment with different proportions of the same three ingredients as we could get very distinct flavours from each loaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re tasting bread with the intensity that some people taste wine, and my palette has developed quite a bit over the past 10 days. I&#39;m thinking that when I get home my sourdough will be a little milder than what we&#39;re getting here, and I&#39;ll have the skills to make the right adjustments to make it so!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Big Boule, Big Flavour</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s another example of what we do with leftover dough. This is a &#39;white&#39; sourdough loaf that has been baked an extra long time. It may look burnt but it&#39;s not at all. The smell is a deep, rich caramel and the taste is exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is an entirely different loaf than a basic sourdough -- much more complex flavour. I really like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are working with dough we always make extra so that we&#39;re sure everyone has enough to practice with. This means that there are always leftovers, which we make into really large loaves and bake off at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rye bread in the picture weigh about 10 pound each. Once they were brown we baked them with the oven door open to keep the heat mellow. It&#39;s the only way to effectively reduce the heat of these large deck ovens when we still want to bake smaller loaves in the lower decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is a good example of the docking technique we used with the rye loaves. We use a roller with long plastic pins to poke even holes all over the loaf before we load it in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the same flour, with different levains. Today was different flours with the same levain (for the most part.) It was a very challenging day since the doughs were especially tricky to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is sourdough rye. Rye is a very delicate, pasty dough that moves really fast so you can&#39;t be too far away from it. But with the addition of sourdough starter it makes for an incredibly delicious loaf which is worth the effort!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle is a sourdough multigrain loaf. This time we roasted the seeds prior to incorporating in the dough and the end result was even better than the yeasted loaf we made in Artisan 1. This is without a doubt the best loaf I&#39;ve ever tasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right was a whole wheat sourdough. While it was fairly easy to work with I have to admit that the flavour was a little plain. We&#39;ve made better loaves than this during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the batard at the back is a 100% whole wheat sourdough made with pumpernickel starter. Now this is a complex loaf. It&#39;s a real pig to work with -- the fragile dough makes shaping very difficult without tearing the dough. But what flavour! It&#39;s complex, wheaty, with a strong rye overtone. This is a bread which I&#39;d be proud to offer in my bakery once I practice the handling and shaping some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONE QUICK NOTE: I&#39;ve made a habit of offering my loaves to the folks that work at my hotel. I found out tonight that I&#39;ve got quite a reputation! Everyone knows my room number because the cleaning staff have remarked about how the room smells very strongly of bread every morning. I&#39;m so used to the smell that I hardly notice any more...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Artisan 2:  It&#39;s Wild, Man!</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/artisan-2-it-s-wild-man/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Artisan 2 course started on Monday.  This course is 95% dedicated to wild yeast bread, aka sourdough.  Sourdough breads take longer to develop and rise, and there&#39;s more effort involved in keeping our wild yeast cultures healthy.   That&#39;s why I&#39;m a little behind in my posting -- I get back from school, eat some bread and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT!  We&#39;re making some great bread, I have pictures, and will share some after school tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- the other 5% of the course is decorative shaping techniques, which will be fun too.  Most of that is Friday afternoon, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday was a day off from Baking School so a group of us toured around San Francisco for the day. It was a brilliant day, warm and sunny, with a gentle breeze coming off the bay. Lots of opportunity for sunburns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent several hours touring around the Ferry Station Market. It&#39;s a huge weekly farmers market with more bread, cheese, oil, fruits and other artisan products than I have ever seen gathered in one place. We sampled our way among the stalls and bought enough fresh goat cheese and fruit to accommodate another week&#39;s worth of bread baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market we walked to the more touristy areas of the city -- Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, Ghiardelli Chocolates, China Town, North Beach (twice) and Union Square. I think we walked over 20km in all but when you are in as diverse and exciting a city as San Francisco we wanted to take in as much as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 1 of my journey at the San Francisco Baking Institute is over, leaving me exhausted and energized at the same time. It was a very good first week -- we deconstructed every component of bread making and assembled the component parts in a whirlwind of combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixing techniques? Pick from short, intensive or improved mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flour? Do you mean bread flour, high-gluten flour, rye, or whole wheat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water? Simple enough, but do you want a stiff, medium or high hydration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-ferments? You bet! But should I use &lt;em&gt;pate fermentee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;poolish&lt;/em&gt; or a sponge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even salt was discussed at length -- what kind, how much and when to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week we had created seven different kinds of baguettes, all with the same four ingredients -- flour, water, salt and yeast. I&#39;ll never look at a baguette the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made several other types of bread which are in the picture above. Let me tell you, the multigrain &lt;em&gt;batard&lt;/em&gt; in the front row is the best tasting loaf of bread I have eaten. Ever. Three days later I get misty when I eat a slice. It&#39;s that good, and I can&#39;t wait to make it for you when I get back to Regina. The whole wheat boules in the background are amazing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the course so far is that I have a much better understanding of the fundamentals of bread baking. This knowledge builds a platform that will allow me to experiment for years to come. It will take me at least three years to exhaust the potential of this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we throw commercial yeast back in the cooler and dive into the amazing world of wild yeast, or sourdough, breads. I sampled some sourdough at lunch last week and I can&#39;t wait to learn more about this complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have energy like never before and wish there was a way to bake for you all over the weekend while I wait for the next class to start. I hope you are all well and I look forward to talking with you all in a couple more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>SFBI Day 5:  Back to the Baguette</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/sfbi-day-5-back-to-the-baguette/"/>
		<updated>2008-02-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/sfbi-day-5-back-to-the-baguette/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Sorry, no pics today -- I forgot the camera in my room!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we wrapped up the Artisan 1 course by experimenting with three different baguette formulas, each featuring a different pre-ferment.  The preferments are designed to add structure and depth of flavour to the standard baguette formula and, depending on the preferment, adjusting the level of acidity in the dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used an old-dough preferment, called &lt;em&gt;pate fermentee&lt;/em&gt;, which we had also used with the various wheat and rye breads yesterday.  It didn&#39;t add near as much in the way of flavour, although I expect it will improve the keeping characteristics of the baguette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also tried a sponge, which is a firm dough containing a tiny amount of yeast and no salt. While the sponge added to the elasticity of the dough making it easier for my heavy hands to shape, it didn&#39;t add much for flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite pre-ferment was the &lt;em&gt;poolish&lt;/em&gt;, which is similar to the sponge (no salt, very small amount of yeast) but has a 100% hydration.  This soupy mix was left to ferment overnight and then added to the baguette mix.  The result was pure ambrosia -- a wide open crumb, crispy crust, creamy colour and the most complex smell and taste of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, Artisan 1 has improved my baking skill, full stop.  I was able to dig into the science of baking breads that I have made at home for years and by digging deeply I have a much better understanding of how to adjust for local flours and local conditions to make a consistently excellent loaf.  Heck, we made seven completely different baguettes from the same four ingredients and only manipulating time, temperature and mixing technique!  I also learned new mixing methods which will improve breads which are already favorites at home.  I can&#39;t wait to make an improved multigrain loaf for our customers in Regina!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also extremely inspiring to work with such talented bakers from around the world.  While we&#39;re all at different stages of our culinary journey, we shared a passion for bread and baking that kept us together as we struggled with new techniques and new working conditions.  I hope we are able to keep in touch as we continue down the road to bread nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a day! Whereas we&#39;ve been making several subtle changes to our baguette formula for the past three days, today we branched out! Five very different varieties with only one thing in common -- each contained a healthy amount of pre-ferment. We used an old dough preferment which is also known as pate fermente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is all that on the table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pDp4PD8wP0-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/pDp4PD8wP0-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;rye loaves&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
A rye loaf made with rye and whole wheat flour.

A whole wheat loaf made with a very high hydration dough. The extra-wet dough made for a very light texture even though it was tricky to handle.
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/msTpO6VF0f-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/msTpO6VF0f-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;three pan loaves&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic white pan bread but made with three very different shaping techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_gKEraPrtA-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_gKEraPrtA-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_gKEraPrtA-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_gKEraPrtA-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;multigrain loaf&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my personal favourite, a fantastic multigrain &lt;em&gt;batard&lt;/em&gt;, with flax seeds, sunflower seeds and millet that was all soaked overnight. The soaked seeds made for a terrifically complex smell and a great texture. This is my favorite bread so far by a long way. I can&#39;t wait to make it at home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made a braided egg bread but it was still baking off at 5PM so we&#39;ll taste it tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we&#39;re back to making baguettes but we&#39;ll be experimenting with different pre-ferment techniques. Then it&#39;s two days off before we&#39;re on to sourdough!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>SFBI Day 3:  All Flour All The Time</title>

&lt;p&gt;It was Flour Day today, where we learned everything we possibly could about the main ingredient in your bread. Everything from the different types of wheat and their properties to the different type of flours that can be milled and &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; properties. I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading on this topic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Artisan-Baking-Maggie-Glezer/dp/1579652913/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;qid=1202349152&amp;amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;Maggie Glezer&#39;s book&lt;/a&gt; explains it very well) but it sure helped to talk about this with a knowledgeable chef and instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas yesterday we took the same ingredients and varied the mixing technique, today we kept the exact same mixing technique and only varied the flour. Our standard artisan bread flour vs. high gluten flour. The comparison is especially relevant for me because Canadians primarily grow Hard Red Spring Wheat which is used in high gluten flour. So therefore, most Canadian &#39;best for bread&#39; flours have a much higher protein content than American artisan bread. High gluten flour is great for machined bread, but the extra protein provides some challenges for the artisan baker since the dough doesn&#39;t tolerate longer fermentations. This usually results in slightly larger, rounder loaves but with a less complex flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the theory stood up to the practical test. The high gluten flour resulted in a rounder baguette with a chewier crust and smaller &amp;quot;ears&amp;quot; and a flatter taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;m off to contact my local miller to better understand the data on his flour and see if I can get locally milled &#39;artisan&#39; flour.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>SFBI Day 2:  Four Ingredients, Three Different Loaves</title>

&lt;p&gt;Another great learning day at the San Francisco Baking Institute. Today we focused on how to manipulate one factor, mixing method, to create three completely different baguettes. The story behind these three baguettes is as interesting as the loaves themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dough was called a &#39;short mix&#39; and represents how bread was traditionally made before the heavy machinery was called in the mid-twentieth century. We still used the mixer, but we only mixed long enough to hydrate the flour before moving the dough to tubs for a long bulk fermentation. The dough was approximately 50% developed when it went into the tubs and we properly developed the gluten by folding the dough every 45 minutes. It was great to see how the dough changed over time, but better yet, how to tell when the gluten was sufficiently developed. This gentle mixing method allowed us to use more water and less yeast, which in turn delivers a more complex flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the third dough we mixed was the &#39;intensive mix&#39;, which represents how dough was mixed after the introduction of high speed mixers. The gluten was 100% developed in the mixer and used less water and more yeast. The end result was a dough which was much tighter and easier to handle, which makes it perfect if we were going to use machines to divide and shape the loaves (we used our hands) at the expense of flavour, texture and colour. There&#39;s a place for intensive mixed doughs, but my preference is for looser doughs and longer fermentations to create a better flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second dough we mixed was the &#39;improved mix&#39;, which represents how artisan bakers pulled back from the intensive mix in order to extract better flavour while still getting the labour saving advantages of the mixer and shorter fermentation times. This was the same mix we used yesterday -- 70% gluten development, more water than the intensive mix but less than the short mix, and an amount of yeast between intensive mix and short mix too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for the method -- how were the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensive mix gave a loaf that was much like I make at home when I don&#39;t use a preferment -- even, slightly dull colour, a chewy crust and a tight, white crumb. Not bad, but no real depth to the flavour or aroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improved mix loaf was wonderful -- a shiny, crisp, crackling crust, light crumb with slightly irregular holes and a nice creamy colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short mix was a delight as well. I got the best &#39;ears&#39; from my slashes, but that was more due to getting the technique right for a change. The loaves had a slightly chewy crust and a creamy crumb with a wide variety of holes. The smell and taste was nicely complex wheaty flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite was the improved mix because of the crust. I just can&#39;t get enough of it! It&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;ve had before; crisp and easy to chew even hours after it was baked. My supper tonight was a baguette with cheese and an apple and it was superb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note: I ended up with 13 baguettes to take home to the hotel tonight. Let me tell you, I&#39;m making friends in the lobby of the Hampton Inn! If any of my Orange Boot customers are feeling deprived, just head down to the Hampton in South San Francisco around 5:30PM and you won&#39;t regret it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/IqpfIy9KIh-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/IqpfIy9KIh-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;my first baguettes&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day was fantastic! I&#39;ll post more detail as the week goes on but suffice to say that this is a really special place. We&#39;re learning a ton of theory, our hands on work is being scrutinized in great detail, and the equipment is top notch. I&#39;ve already met some incredibly interesting people, from a hotel chef from Maui to a culinary instructor from Melbourne to an artisan baker from Victoria who&#39;s bakery I know a bit about through our travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first baguettes passed the chef&#39;s close inspection fairly well today. There is lots for me to improve on in the shaping and scoring department but I was glad that there was sufficient goodness in there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and in case you still don&#39;t want to be down here too -- we get to take all the bread we make home with us! So I passed out four baguettes in the lobby of the hotel when I got back and ate one for supper. It was without a doubt the best baguette I&#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a few photos from Day 1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/orangeboot/sets/72157603855278075/&quot;&gt;on Flickr if you&#39;re interested&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Super Bowl in Stockton</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PNmAumd1S--700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/PNmAumd1S--400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; alt=&quot;Mark and Melodie&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who&#39;s that old bugger wearing my shirt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my big regrets whenever I come to San Francisco for work is that I don&#39;t get the chance to see my cousin Melodie in Stockton. So Sunday was my chance to make amends. I rented a car, printed out my Google map, sufficiently notified next of kin and, after a quick breakfast, took to the open road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, open road is a bit of a misnomer in California, even at 9:00AM on a Sunday morning. The road to Stockton is nothing but US Interstate -- four lanes in both directions with bumper to bumper traffic at 70 miles per hour. My first highway, #101, is actually a three lane highway which has been given the odd treatment of expanding to four lanes without having added any pavement. They just tarred over the old lines and put new lines in, so that the outside lanes are right tight against the concrete curb. It was uncomfortably tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular stretch of highway had me wondering if I was really cut out for this trip at all. It starts with a left turn from the far right lane, the off ramp swooping majestically up and over all eight lanes of Highway 101, before setting car and driver down facing due east. After a half mile or so, I could see the road rising up in front of me, 30 feet or more into the air. Oh, yes, I got to drive OVER the San Francisco Bay! The San Mateo Bridge seems to cover 5 miles with over half the bridge high in the air so ships can go underneath, and half the bridge low along the water. It was quite exhilarating but I suspect Cindy wouldn&#39;t have liked it one bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually made it to Stockton and found Melodie&#39;s house without incident. Melodie, her boyfriend Jeff and I had a wonderful lunch at a place down the highway called BJ&#39;s brewhouse (my leftovers will keep me in suppers for most of the week) and then beat a hasty retreat to her house to watch the Super Bowl. What a game! What commercials they have in the USA!! What a way for me to win the Kuhn Bowl with a last minute touchdown!! Oh yeah, the Giants won too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was especially blessed to get a chance to visit with Mel&#39;s folks (and my Aunt and Uncle) who as luck would have it were visiting from Michigan. My family is quite small and spread out so we don&#39;t get to see each other very often. I was very sad to leave for the long drive back to my hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Flying to San Francisco to Bake, Bake, Bake!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/flying-to-san-francisco-to-bake-bake-bake/"/>
		<updated>2008-02-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/flying-to-san-francisco-to-bake-bake-bake/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I flew out to San Francisco for three weeks of serious training at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbi.com/&quot;&gt;San Francisco Baking Institute&lt;/a&gt; (more background available at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangeboot.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/orange-boot-update-time-to-learn/&quot;&gt;Orange Boot site&lt;/a&gt;.) It was a good flight overall but I have to admit that these frequent flier points programs sure seem bent on punishing their customers. I booked my flight using Aeroplan points and out of 15 possible flights from Regina to San Francisco on Saturday the only one with a seat available involved a 7 hour layover in Calgary. I made the most of it by calling up my aunt Donna for a spur of the moment lunch. Donna, Jerry and their 12 year old daughter Morgan swept me out of the airport for a long, lingering lunch and a wonderful visit. Thanks for such a wonderful afternoon -- I can&#39;t think of a better diversion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, my time at Calgary International Airport was cut from 7 hours to 3.5, but I still had some interesting times. I helped an older couple find their gate for a flight to Las Vegas (I hope they tip their dealers) and watched a delightful group of seniors collect themselves for the flight to San Francisco. These were seriously old folks, all well into their eighties, and it looked like they regularly traveled together. Whenever another traveling companion arrived they were greeted with a loud Whoop! and shouts of &amp;quot;You made it!&amp;quot; I can&#39;t help but hope that will be Cindy and me one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also met a girl from Austria who is working in San Jose at a hotel as part of a management trainee program. She was recruited by the hotel for this 18 month program right out of college. She had spent a week skiing in Lake Louise with her father who had flown over from Europe. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Austrian friend was also reading the German edition of the final Harry Potter book. The book looked much thicker than the English version; perhaps German words are longer. My esteem for this girl, who goes halfway around the world to learn how to work in hotel and jets to Lake Louise for a skiing weekend, fell a wee bit as she told me that she was nearly at the end of the book, she thought it was really exciting, then over the course of our flight put the book down at least a dozen times to do something else. In our family, one doesn&#39;t eat, sleep, wash or notice any other family members until the book is finished. That&#39;s just the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Update:  Time to Learn</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-update-time-to-learn/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was exactly like the picture I had in my mind about baking in winter. Mild, mostly sunny, but with a delicate snowfall off and on throughout the day. Huge snowflakes piling up on my staging table that were easily swept off between loads. It was beautiful and relaxing - completely unlike the bitter cold, windy mess we have outside today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not baking this Friday, or for the next few weeks, as I&#39;m off to San Francisco for some serious training at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbi.com/&quot;&gt;San Francisco Baking Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Serious in that I fully expect a hard three weeks spent investigating each part of the baking process in detail, from the basic ingredients through mixing, fermentation, shaping and baking. I won&#39;t be surprised if every part of our current technique is broken down, modified and rebuilt. It will be worth it if, when I get home, I can improve our existing varieties and bring you some new recipes too. I&#39;ve got my chef&#39;s jacket and check pants packed and ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time at SFBI is actually three separate courses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbi.com/workshop_artisan1.html&quot;&gt;Artisan I&lt;/a&gt; is focused on the basics of bread making and will form the foundation for the other courses. I expect we&#39;ll be making as much bread in the first five days as we&#39;ve made at Orange Boot since October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbi.com/workshop_artisan2.html&quot;&gt;Artisan II&lt;/a&gt; is all about wild yeast breads aka sourdough. Our wild yeast loaves haven&#39;t scaled up as well as I&#39;d like compared to the small batches we&#39;ve made over the past 5-7 years, so I&#39;m eager to get some good theory and practical experience working with large batches of wild yeast dough. And if you&#39;re going to learn about sourdough, San Francisco is the place to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third week is focussed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbi.com/workshop_whole_grain_breads.html&quot;&gt;whole grains and specialty flours&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;ve had several requests for whole grain breads along with lower gluten flours like spelt. Here&#39;s a chance to get skilled in this new and exciting area of artisan baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, have you noticed how whole grains are &#39;new&#39; and the current hot topic of nutrition? That&#39;s one of the ironies of what we&#39;re doing at Orange Boot Bakery -- taking &#39;old&#39; ingredients and techniques to make better bread. When you&#39;re not making 50,000 loaves per day you can focus on flavour and nutrition which means going back to the way bread was made over 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My evenings will be spent making some changes to our website and email lists along with sending you the odd update from the field. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t plug up your inbox, but if anything especially interesting goes on I&#39;ll let you know. I&#39;ll be describing things in more detail on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the weekends I&#39;m hoping to head up to the Sonoma Valley north of San Francisco to see the bakeries I&#39;ve only read about. Places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artisanbakers.com/&quot;&gt;Artisan Breads&lt;/a&gt;, owned by world champion baker Craig Ponsford, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dellafattoria.com/della.htm&quot;&gt;Della Fattoria&lt;/a&gt;, who use two huge Alan Scott ovens just like ours, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schats.com/bakery.htm&quot;&gt;Schat&#39;s Courthouse Bakery&lt;/a&gt; in Ukiah, whose owner wrote the best book on running a bakery that I&#39;ve ever seen. There are 6-10 others I want to see too. I&#39;m taking the camera and laptop so hopefully there will be some nice pictures to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be back in Regina on the Feb 23rd, hopefully with big burly shoulders and a head full of new ideas. If everything works out I hope to get back baking in time for all your Leap Year parties on the 29th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My Introduction to Daring Bakers:  Lemon Meringue Pie</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-introduction-to-daring-bakers-lemon-meringue-pie/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-introduction-to-daring-bakers-lemon-meringue-pie/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love pie. Fruit pies are my favorite, but I have a special place in my stomach for lemon meringue pies, especially real pie made from real lemons. So when the Daring Bakers, an internet group of amateur bakers which I recently joined, announced Lemon Meringue Pie as their challenge for January, I was very excited. So excited that I actually missed one of Robyn&#39;s hockey games to make the pie without any time pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemon meringue pie consists of three distinct layers -- pastry, lemon custard and meringue -- and each layer has its unique challenges. Will the crust be too tough? Will it leak? Will the custard set up properly? Will the meringue be firm enough to slice without getting all hard and crumbly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wU7M3PsWvi-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wU7M3PsWvi-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wU7M3PsWvi-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/wU7M3PsWvi-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;crust ready for baking&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crust ready for baking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not made a pastry crust in quite a while and it took some time to get my confidence up. It took a couple extra mils of water to get the crust to stick together, but it rolled and shaped well, even if it did puff up a little while baking. My happy pie weights didn&#39;t do a complete job this time. Next time I&#39;ll bake it a little longer with the weights and make the flutes a little higher since the dough shrunk back quite a bit while baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4bf_KwuW6W-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4bf_KwuW6W-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4bf_KwuW6W-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/4bf_KwuW6W-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Custard ready to go&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Custard ready to go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The custard was a lot of fun to make. It thickened up quickly and the flavour was spot on. There was a little extra which I kept in a bowl to test how it set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MZG3UIaClA-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MZG3UIaClA-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/MZG3UIaClA-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/MZG3UIaClA-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;273&quot; alt=&quot;Ready for oven&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready for oven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meringue also went really well, I thought. I don&#39;t really know my soft peaks from my firm peaks but it seemed to work find and looked gorgeous before and after baking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/XyU9zqnnK3-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/XyU9zqnnK3-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/XyU9zqnnK3-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/XyU9zqnnK3-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;first try was a little runny&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;first try was a little runny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After waiting a loooong 2 1/2 hours for the pie to cool (and Cindy and Robyn to get home from hockey) we dug in. I was stunned that a pie which looked so beautiful had so many problems! Tough crust, runny custard and a meringue that didn&#39;t stay together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a little internet research and have a couple ideas as to what to do next time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crust: Use a little more water early so I don&#39;t have to work it so much. Use the pie weights for another 5 minutes or so when baking. I might even go to my traditional pastry crust with shortening for some added flakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;custard: chill the pie prior to slicing so it sets up more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meringue: top the pie while the custard is hot so the bottom of the meringue bakes well. Possibly beat the meringue a little stiffer too; I may have only had medium peaks after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the pie tasted really good, even if it didn&#39;t look the best. I had enough ingredients to make another pie but life took over and even though my Daring Baker pie was made on January 5 I haven&#39;t had the time for another attempt. Maybe in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the folks at Daring Bakers for the challenge -- I&#39;m looking forward to February already!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Of Dough and Wind Chill</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/of-dough-and-wind-chill/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/of-dough-and-wind-chill/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I built the brick oven in our yard, one of the questions people asked (and I asked myself) was &amp;quot;Will it work in the depths of a prairie winter?&amp;quot; I always figured we&#39;d be OK so long as we didn&#39;t let the oven freeze solid but until last week I admit I felt a little trepidation. Well, things went amazingly well, even with temperatures around -25C and the wind chill at -40C. A couple notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oven heated up pretty much as usual. Maybe a little longer burn, but nothing too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oven did cool a little quicker than normal. Once the mass is saturated, it usually cools about 10F per hour. In the freezing cold last week, the temperature dropped 20F per hour, which is still very manageable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door is still the biggest source of heat loss. I had to switch the loaves around a bit but, again, given the temperatures outside it was more than acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever thought to position the oven so the back blocked north winds was pretty smart! We were as sheltered as possible, without having the oven indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can load the oven really, really quickly when my hands are freezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those human interest stories on the news are true -- exposed flesh does freeze in a minute or so. I got a mild case of frostbite on my hands by the end of the bake day. Nothing too bad but I had purple fingers for a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, a great learning experience and I was really pleased with the quality of our midwinter bread. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed baking it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really excited about introducing some new bread to the list over the coming weeks, but this week we&#39;re going to stick with some old standbys to keep your bellies full during the short days. Comfort food to enjoy wrapped in a blanket, in your favorite chair with a good book and a cup of tea...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/multigrain_batard.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/multigrain_batard.thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g &lt;em&gt;Batard&lt;/em&gt;, $4.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Potato, Cheddar and Chive Torpedo: This is a huge favorite with the folks who like cheese bread (like, everyone in our family for example.) With real potatoes, sharp cheddar cheese and a healthy portion of chives in each loaf, I think of it as &#39;perogie bread&#39;. Either way it&#39;s a really tasty treat and is great on its own or in a funky sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/cheddar_chive.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Cheddar Chive&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/cheddar_chive.thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cheddar Chive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Potato, Cheddar and Chive Torpedo, 750g &lt;em&gt;Batard&lt;/em&gt;, $5.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn promises to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don&#39;t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Flu bugs can&#39;t stop us!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/flu-bugs-can-t-stop-us/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/flu-bugs-can-t-stop-us/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, last week was a bit of a challenge, to say the least. I got hit by a nasty flu bug on Thursday and I&#39;m still working my way back to full fitness, so the vast majority of the firing, baking and packaging fell to Cindy last week. I helped where I could from a respectful distance and wrapped in a blanket, but it all worked out in the end. Sorry I wasn&#39;t able to say Hi to everyone who picked up bread but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree it was for the best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could tell we were a little out of kilter because for the first time in our history, Friday didn&#39;t have the nicest weather of the week. I know it wasn&#39;t too terrible, but I&#39;m used to seeing sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures when we&#39;re baking. Perhaps we&#39;ll be treated to a chinook this time round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we&#39;re making two slight modifications to some old favourites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Orange Boot Birdseed Loaf: This is a &amp;quot;transitional&amp;quot; multigrain loaf -- that is, it still contains white flour but has lots of healthy additions like wheat bran, buttermilk and of course, fresh-roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds. The roasted seeds give the loaf a unique flavour and crunchy chew. Yum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/birdseed.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orange Boot Birdseed&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/birdseed.thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orange Boot Birdseed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Orange Boot Birdseed Loaf, 750g Batard, $4.00 [Note that the shape is different than pictured, but the insides are the same!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Our Semolina Loaf is a simple loaf with a deceptively complex flavour thanks to an extremely slow rise. We start building the dough Wednesday for a Friday bake and the dough does most of its rising in the cooler. The bread contains a mix of white flour and durum semolina flour from locally grown, organic grain and when shaped in the traditional &#39;S&#39; and topped with sesame seeds becomes &lt;em&gt;Pane Siciliano&lt;/em&gt;, which makes it more fun too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/siciliano_big_50.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Pane Sicliano&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://orangeboot.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/siciliano_big_50.thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pane Sicliano&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pane Siciliano&lt;/em&gt;, 500g S-shaped loaf, $3.50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn promises to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don’t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just figured out how to blog about a photo that I uploaded to Flickr. So now you all get to see Cindy and me from this summer on Vancouver Island. Not sure which of the kids took it but it turned out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the kids get taller the angle on the pictures look better too!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Update:  Baking in January</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-update-baking-in-january/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-update-baking-in-january/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello Bread Lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather has warmed up a bit and we&#39;ve found a source of seasoned firewood, so we&#39;re back to baking this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&#39;re getting back into the swing of things, we&#39;ll be sticking to two of your favorites this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: We&#39;re no longer making sandwich loaves in the brick oven. You&#39;ll get the same great flavour in an oblong shape -- it&#39;s still a nice high loaf which is great for your morning toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2: There&#39;s nothing ordinary about our &lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt; - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise starting Thursday night to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street.

		<title>Happy New Year from Orange Boot Bakery</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/happy-new-year-from-orange-boot-bakery/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/happy-new-year-from-orange-boot-bakery/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello Bread Lovers! Happy New Year everyone. We hope you are all having a wonderful holiday season. December has been a very busy and exciting month for us and it was nice to take a few days off to relax and have fun as a family. We&#39;re getting ready to start baking again and we&#39;ll have a &#39;bread order&#39; email shortly. This isn&#39;t it, though. There have been several inquiries about what we&#39;ve been up to so this email is a summary of the events of the past couple weeks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bakery&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Bakery &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/happy-new-year-from-orange-boot-bakery/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of December attempting to purchase the existing bakery in the River Heights mall on Regina Ave and Montague St. Pretty much did it too, but on December 18 we finally decided to hold off for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space was larger than we needed, the equipment much older than we&#39;d like and the layout is pretty awkward too. The good news is we had a really good meeting with the mall landlord and will work together to design an appropriate space in the mall over the next 18 months or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re both excited about the type of bakery we want to build. In the meantime, however, we&#39;re still looking for some rental space (hopefully with equipment) so we can continue to bake 1-2 days a week for all of you. We have pretty much maxxed out what we can do in the house while still preserving our sanity, so if any of you know of a commercial kitchen we can rent by the hour, please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bread&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Bread &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/happy-new-year-from-orange-boot-bakery/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last four months have been a lot of fun as we&#39;ve worked to figure out how to scale up our baking, manage the brick oven and expand on the types of breads we offer. We learned a couple really good things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60 loaves per baking day is a good number when baking out of the house. We did 75 on December 1 and that was hard, and the 155 we did on December 14 pushed us (mixer, oven, Mark and Cindy) to the limit. So the solution is to expand to a bigger space (with bigger equipment), bake two days per week, or change my mixing technique. We&#39;re open to ideas here -- please let us know if something &#39;obvious&#39; comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread pans are damaging the brick oven. We were disappointed to learn that the heavy pans we&#39;re using for our multigrain and birdseed bread are causing the firebrick hearth to deteriorate. Lots of scoring on the bricks from sliding the pans in and out of the oven. So we will no longer be offering pan breads (aka &#39;sandwich loaves&#39;) and will be investing in proofing baskets so you can still get nice high loaves for your morning toast. We started experimenting with the baskets in December and are pleased with the results. We think you will be pleased as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every step on this adventure we&#39;ve been obsessive about how to provide the very best experience for each and every one of you. What new breads do you want to see? How can we make ordering easier? Can we improve how the bread is packaged or delivered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are our &#39;A-team&#39; and we rely on your comments to make the bread and the bakery the best you&#39;ve ever experienced. We&#39;re thrilled that you are part of this -- please keep the comments and suggestions coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year everyone. We look forward to seeing you again in January!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What can I cover best?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-can-i-cover-best/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-can-i-cover-best/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; writes about how newspapers are laying off excellent reporters as they stop coverage of national topics to focus on local news. He offers an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/01/02/halfway-round-the-track/&quot;&gt;excellent alternative&lt;/a&gt; which preserves the great work the reporters are creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the post he links to an earlier post which really struck a chord with me. Jeff asserts that a key principle of blogging is to &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/&quot;&gt;Cover what you do best, and link to the rest.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like that. It ties in well with the &amp;quot;hyper-local&amp;quot; reporting idea I was kicking around last year -- forget talking about what&#39;s happening in Regina and focus in on my neighbourhood, or my street, or my front yard. I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigcreek.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;first prototype&lt;/a&gt; on Wordpress but it&#39;s a little stagnant right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can apply Jeff&#39;s ideas in 2008 blogging two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;linking to other blogs a lot more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;figuring out what I&#39;m &amp;quot;best at&amp;quot; and covering that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I best at? I&#39;ve got a few ideas, all involving what&#39;s going on in my local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you best at? Please share!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>New Year, New Goals</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/new-year-new-goals/"/>
		<updated>2008-01-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/new-year-new-goals/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been one year since my foray into blogging and I have mixed feelings about my results. I&#39;ve spent far more time reading other blogs (I consider myself a &#39;whiz&#39; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; and am progressing to full ninja status) than actually writing. I&#39;ve also spent far too long worrying about the focus of the blog than getting my thoughts in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this year I resolve to worry less and write more. My goal is two posts per week. Warning in advance that the topics are going to cover a pretty wide range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;observations about my family: growth, change, stirring victories and sad losses too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what it&#39;s like to build a business: as we slowly build Orange Boot Bakery.  I&#39;m fascinated by the process of starting and growing a business. I want to put everything I&#39;ve learned in business and life into the bakery and share the foibles. I&#39;m going to write about the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; here. The Orange Boot Bakery site is for our customers and I don&#39;t want to clog it up with weird ramblings about being a small business owner. (&lt;em&gt;2023 update: it&#39;s all here, all the time.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the joys and struggles in building community, be it our local community association, the kid&#39;s minor hockey teams or the various groups I&#39;m involved with online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s new and exciting (to me) in internet technology. My professional career has been about helping people through the learning curve when it comes to new technology. I spent the early part of 2007 thinking I had fallen way behind the times but I&#39;m still ahead of the curve compared to 90% of people so there&#39;s likely lots to learn here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only fear is that the variety of subject matter will turn people off. Well it can&#39;t be worse than not posting at all, right? I&#39;ll make judicious use of tags / categories and if I do find a Voice in all of this, I can adjust later. But the goal for now is to write -- two per week, come hell or high water.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot #11:  Final Bake Day Before Christmas</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-11-final-bake-day-before-christmas/"/>
		<updated>2007-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-11-final-bake-day-before-christmas/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We hope you’re having a great December so far. Things have been really busy for us – Robyn got over her flu bug, a little hockey was played and we’re getting used to the fact that it’s going to be really, really cold for some time yet. But nothing beats the cold like a wood fire and fresh bread, so we’re back baking this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: This Friday will be the last baking day for us before Christmas –- we’re frantically trying to get our head around leasing a commercial space in the New Year (more details below) and we need to get some shopping done too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Week: Many of your old favourites -- order some extra to freeze if you need. All the loaves freeze well; the multigrain especially so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large sandwich loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Our “birdseed” loaf is a multi-grain loaf chock-full of roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds. The seeds add extra crunchiness and pack a lot of flavour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Birdseed Bread, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: There’s nothing ordinary about our &lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt; - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French Loaf (&lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt;), 700g Batard, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4 (Sweet Special): Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread. This is a very pretty sweet loaf, with six strands of dough all braided together and baked till a golden brown. A luxurious treat with a hint of oranges and as many cranberries and nuts as we can cram in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread, 850g Braided Loaf, $7.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you’ve got a large gathering, we’d be glad to make a 1.2kg behemoth for you for $9.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#5 (Savory Special): Herb and Garlic Focaccia. This amazing flatbread is built over two days for maximum flavour and then we go even further with a home-made herb oil. Wow! This is sold as a slab which you can cut up for guests or tear apart with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Herb Focaccia, 8”x12” slab, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don&#39;t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week! Mark, Cindy, Ben and Robyn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What&#39;s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we might be going “legit” sooner than we thought. An opportunity came up to take over a local bake shop and we’re seriously considering going for it. Lots of details to work out – negotiations, financing, equipment appraisals, staffing, renovations to plan, etc. and we’re trying to get a final decision made before Christmas. Exciting and scary all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark is also enrolling in an Artisan Bread baking course at the San Francisco Baking Institute in early 2008 so we can offer up some new and interesting varieties for you to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn’t enough, Mark’s researching some new whole grain breads to give you some even healthier alternatives. More news to come in the New Year on this topic too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot #9:  Rider Pride and Frozen Toes</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello Bread Lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent far too long yesterday reflecting on how I could feel so darn happy after watching football on TV this weekend. Very entertaining 2-0 win by Arsenal over Wigan Athletic on Saturday and a pretty darn special CFL game on Sunday. I know I&#39;m not the only one thinking how things have changed in our lives since the last time the Grey Cup came to Saskatchewan. One example -- we received lots of nice comments about how our Herb Focaccia was a tasty addition to your Grey Cup parties; in 1989 the only wheat products I consumed came in an amber bottle...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, we&#39;re offering our &amp;quot;Sweet and Savory&amp;quot; specials again this week along with a basic (but exceptional) french loaf. We want to keep the number of varieties each week small so we can focus on producing bread of a very high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: There&#39;s nothing ordinary about our &lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt; - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French Loaf (&lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt;), 700g Batard, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 (Sweet Special): Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread. This is a very pretty sweet loaf, with six strands of dough all braided together and baked till a golden brown. A luxurious treat with a hint of oranges and as many cranberries and nuts as we can cram in there! We were overwhelmed by the response last week -- I wish I took a picture of our prep table laid out with over 150 little dough strands waiting to be braided!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread, 850g Braided Loaf, $7.00 Note: If you’ve got a large gathering, we’d be glad to make a 1.2kg behemoth for you for $9.00. #3 (Savory Special): Herb and Garlic Focaccia. This amazing flatbread is built over two days for maximum flavour and then we go over the top with a home-made herb oil. Wow! This is sold as a slab which you can cut up for guests or tear apart with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What&#39;s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots, as usual!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, we&#39;re pleased to announce that our daughter Robyn has taken over the position of VP of Replies and Keeper of the Order List. She&#39;ll be confirming all your orders from now on and making sure I bake the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I&#39;m fretting over how the oven will perform now that the weather has turned extra cold. We&#39;ll be paying close attention to the firing time on Thursday to make sure the oven is good and hot come bake time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we&#39;re trying to find the right balance between baking old favorites (multigrain, birdseed, cheddar-chive) while also getting our wild yeast breads and lean doughs just right. We&#39;re working on a monthly bake schedule so that you can stock up on your favorites and we can still experiment with new varieties too. More news to come next week!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 8:  Snowy, but warm inside!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-8-snowy-but-warm-inside/"/>
		<updated>2007-11-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-8-snowy-but-warm-inside/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is our eighth week of baking for friends and family. Two month’s worth of good bread, prepared with care every Friday. It’s extremely gratifying to see the smiles and hear the great comments about our bread. We really appreciate it – frankly, making a direct happy contribution to your weekend is a big reason why we’re doing this in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re approaching the time of year where many of us are heading out to Christmas parties, pot luck suppers or maybe even hosting a gathering of your own. We think we can help you out a bit in this regard, by offering two very special breads to go along with our regular fare (which is special in its own way!) So you will see two special loaves each week from now till the New Year. One sweet, one savory – either will make a nice gift, pot luck contribution or decadent treat for a winter evening in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s offerings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Orange Boot Multigrain Loaf: Our best seller, this large sandwich loaf is bursting with corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and local organic unbleached flour. A touch of honey and plenty of buttermilk gives a touch of sweetness and tang too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Saskatchewan Sourdough: Flour, water and salt. Take three simple ingredients, add lots and lots of time, and you get the most complex and delightful flavour possible. If Mark was stranded on a desert island, this is the bread he’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saskatchewan Sourdough, 700g Batard, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3 (Sweet Special): Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread. This is a very pretty sweet loaf, with six strands of dough all braided together and baked till a golden brown. A luxurious treat with a hint of oranges and as many cranberries and nuts as we can cram in there! We were sampling this loaf last Friday and got 100% huge grins from everyone who tried it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread, 850g Braided Loaf, $7.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is slightly smaller than the 1.2kg behemoth we served up last week, to make it a little more manageable for you. If you’ve got a large gathering, we’d be glad to make the big ‘un for you for $9.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4 (Savory Special): Herb and Garlic Focaccia. This amazing flatbread is built over two days for maximum flavour and then we go over the top with olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs. Wow! This is sold as a slab which you can cut up for guests or tear apart with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Herb Focaccia, 8”x12” slab, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street.

So if you don&#39;t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What&#39;s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got heat in the garage! Yay! We’re still mixing in the house, but fermentation, shaping and proofing has moved to the garage to be closer to the oven. Your bread is also available for pickup in the garage too. Please come on in!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 7:  All-Request Baking!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-7-all-request-baking/"/>
		<updated>2007-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-7-all-request-baking/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was great to get back to baking last week. The weather has been remarkable all fall and that continued. Each week is a little colder but the sun keeps trying to warm us up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was a great example of what we mean when we say we&#39;re still starting up. The combination of extra-fast rising and a too-hot oven meant our semolina loaf was not up to our standards. So, several of our customers got shorted on their order. It was double disappointing because we haven&#39;t been able to share our favorite loaf at its best -- yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Week: we&#39;ve received several requests for specific varieties so some of your favorites are making a re-appearance on our menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Our &amp;quot;birdseed&amp;quot; loaf is a slightly sweet multi-grain loaf chock-full of roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds. The seeds add extra crunchiness and pack a lot of flavour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Birdseed Bread, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Our Cheddar-Chive torpedo is a big favorite as well. Potatoes are added to the dough for extra smoothness, fresh chives are mixed in for a great herb flavour and aged cheddar cheese adds a lovely bite. This loaf looks great and tastes even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The limiting ingredient here is the amount of fresh chives I can find in November. Please order as much as you like but we may have to limit quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheddar-Chive Torpedo, 600g, $5.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: We&#39;ll bake it later in the day, when the oven&#39;s cooler. We&#39;ll have a dedicated person watching the dough rise. We&#39;ll never give up! Pane Sicliano is on the menu again. This deep brown ‘S’ shaped loaf contains Durum flour in the dough and roasted sesame seeds on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semolina Loaf (Pane Siciliano), 500g loaf, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, November 16 and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don’t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What’s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re really pleased to announce that we have an official flour supplier! Bob Balfour at R&amp;amp;J Milling in Riceton, Saskatchewan is an organic grain farmer who mills several varieties of flour, including the unbleached white flour and semolina flour we&#39;ve used over the past several weeks. We&#39;re going to be working with Bob to test new flours over the next few months. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 6:  The Bread is Back!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-6-the-bread-is-back/"/>
		<updated>2007-11-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-6-the-bread-is-back/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our construction work is still in progress, but we can&#39;t wait any longer -- we need to bake! Here&#39;s hoping you&#39;re in need of some bread this week too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &#39;back to basic&#39; week. Three loaves which are the building blocks of all the bread we make. But don&#39;t let that deter you! Sometimes the simplest things are the best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Our multigrain loaf is our best seller. OK, it&#39;s also the most offered loaf but people really seem to like it. This large sandwich loaf contains corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and honey in addition to wheat flour giving a complex and slightly sweet flavour. It&#39;s the mainstay of our breakfast routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Our semolina loaf (&lt;em&gt;Pane Siciliano&lt;/em&gt;) doesn&#39;t the love it deserves -- until you taste it. This deep brown &#39;S&#39; shaped loaf contains Durum flour in the dough and roasted sesame seeds on top. It&#39;s Cindy&#39;s favorite. Yummy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semolina Loaf (&lt;em&gt;Pane Siciliano&lt;/em&gt;), 500g loaf, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: There&#39;s nothing ordinary about our &lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt; - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French Loaf (&lt;em&gt;Pain Ordinaire&lt;/em&gt;), 700g Batard, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, November 9 and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don&#39;t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What&#39;s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have power in the garage and we have a furnace in the garage. But we don&#39;t have power connected to the furnace yet. Brrr!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our week away from baking meant we put a great many hours into getting the prep / pickup area cleaned up, but there is still a lot of work to do. So pickup is in the house for at least another week. It&#39;s getting there, though.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the problems people have been mentioning is not getting emails from the Orange Boot. The main reason is that I forget to add you to my Outlook email list. That&#39;s pretty risky for both of us -- we miss out on a regular customer and you miss out on good bread. Booo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can fix that. Now you can subscribe to updates from the website. Just check over on the sidebar where it says &#39;Subscribe.&#39; Over there, on the right hand side of the screen ----&amp;gt; See the two links? &amp;quot;Subscribe by email&amp;quot; will 100% guarantee that you will get every single update on this site sent to your email inbox. &amp;quot;Subscribe in a reader&amp;quot; will let you get updates sent to your favorite RSS feed reader (if you don&#39;t know about RSS, just stick with email.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, in three clicks or less you&#39;ll be guaranteed never to miss an update, and never miss a chance to get some great bread. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 4:  Return of Some Old Friends</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-4-return-of-some-old-friends/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-4-return-of-some-old-friends/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello Bread Lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the bread last week. We had our busiest day yet with several new customers joining the Orange Boot list and a great many repeat orders, but we&#39;re also getting the hang of the daily bake schedule now too. So even though we baked the most bread yet, we still had a chance to chat with everyone. That really makes the sore shoulders worthwhile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are bringing back some old favourites this week -- a nice mix of bread styles to satisfy the most particular craving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Our multigrain loaf received a huge amount of positive feedback two weeks ago. This large sandwich loaf contains corn meal, rolled oats, brown rice and honey in addition to wheat flour giving a complex and slightly sweet flavour. If you didn&#39;t get a chance to make toast with this bread last time, please get enough to try it this time. It makes the best toast ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Multigrain, 800g Sandwich Loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Our semolina loaf (Pane Siciliano) was turned out a little rustic looking on Week #1 but the flavour was spot on. This deep brown &#39;S&#39; shaped loaf contains Durum flour in the dough and roasted sesame seeds on top. Yummy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semolina Loaf (Pane Siciliano), 500g loaf, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: I couldn&#39;t keep enough Saskatchewan Sourdough around last week, so we&#39;re making more this week. The wild yeast starter is strong and ready to perform for you once again. We add some whole wheat and rye flour for extra (not too sour) flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saskatchewan Sourdough (Pain au Levain), 700g Boule, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4: There&#39;s nothing ordinary about our Pain Ordinaire - our french loaf is given an extra slow rise to extract the most flavour from our organic flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French Loaf (Pain Ordinaire), 700g Batard, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, October 26 and can be picked up at 2904 Wascana Street. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please Note&lt;/em&gt; -- we promise to reply and confirm every email order we receive. So if you don&#39;t hear from us within 24 hours please call or email again. We had a couple orders slip through the cracks and I still don&#39;t know how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark and Cindy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben and Robyn (chief order takers and phone support!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mark@madbaker.com / cindy@madbaker.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=== What&#39;s Happening at the Orange Boot? ===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas work got delayed by a week but we&#39;re told it will be Thursday. Touch wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re working on getting bread pictures on the web site so you can see what you&#39;re ordering. Hoping to get a start on that this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid week essay didn&#39;t happen last week. Sorry about that. I think I over-reached. Right now we&#39;re focused on getting better order tracking so we don&#39;t miss you. That and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 3:  Seeds, Onions and the Search for Mellow</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-3-seeds-onions-and-the-search-for-mellow/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-3-seeds-onions-and-the-search-for-mellow/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Cindy and I decided it was time to start spreading the word about our brick oven bread, we saw this as a way to make stronger connections -- with our ingredients, the baking process and especially with our friends. My dream is to have a weekly chat with each of you to stay connected while at the same time sharing some of the very best food we can make to sustain you during the week. While we&#39;re getting there, we haven&#39;t exactly reached the ultimate dream state and last Friday was an extreme case of our all too standard craziness. We had trenches, electricians, gas fitters, hockey practice and a birthday party all converge at the same time Friday while we were also baking over three dozen loaves. Suffice to say I didn&#39;t get a chance to chat with some of you near as much as I would have liked. I promise to make it up to you this week, if you have the time of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrical work is done and the trench is filled in (YAY!!) but we still don&#39;t have heat / cooling in the prep area, so we&#39;re restricting things to three varieties again this week. But don&#39;t let that dampen things -- the three loaves we&#39;re offering will amaze, astound and delight! Or at the very least, taste really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: There has been a wee clamour to add some whole grain / different grain bread to the Orange Boot repertoire, so I spent some time delving deep into my notes for some grainier, seedier options. Whole grain baking is a different beast, especially without any commercial additives, high speed mixers or high humidity proofing, but I think we have a loaf that, while not exactly granola, is pretty darn hearty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Boot Birdseed Bread: a big ol&#39; sandwich loaf with roasted pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds for a crunchy texture and nutty flavour. A solid base for your favorite sandwich toppings or to dunk in a fall soup. 800g loaf, $4.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Saskatchewan Sourdough (Pain au Levain): If I could make only one bread for you, this would be it. I&#39;ve been nurturing a wild yeast starter for over 6 weeks getting ready to introduce this king of breads and the time is now. You will be amazed at the delicate flavours the wild yeast evokes from only flour, water and salt. Its’ flavour is much milder than Boudin&#39;s in San Francisco, so if you think you don&#39;t like sourdough bread, please try ours. You&#39;ll be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saskatchewan Sourdough: 700g Boule, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: Finally, for those of you who like &#39;stuff&#39; in your bread but not &#39;seeds&#39;, we offer up an Onion and Herb Ciabatta. A loaf so fragrant you&#39;ll wonder how it could ever taste as good as it smells, until you taste it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onion and Herb Ciabatta: 500g rustic loaf, $3.50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has been our custom so far — please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to mark@madbaker.com or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup at 2904 Wascana Street between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, October 19. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 6:00PM Friday but please call in advance to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes this week!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Two Programmers, One Medium</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/two-programmers-one-medium/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/two-programmers-one-medium/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooper.com/&quot;&gt;Alan Cooper&lt;/a&gt; has published and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooper.com/insights/journal_of_design/articles/design_engineering_the_next_st.html&quot;&gt;excellent article&lt;/a&gt; on why the results of software projects are so unpredictable. His point is that there are two types of programmers -- design engineers who like to design elegant solutions to problems and production engineers who want to develop code that is rock solid and able to be used by the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as Cooper sees it, is that both &#39;engineers&#39; use the same medium for expression -- source code. This is different than other disciplines, like bridge building, where designers use paper and computers and production folk use iron, bricks, concrete, etc. When you use the same medium it&#39;s tough to differentiate whether you&#39;re doing design or production work, which leads to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is part 1 of 2, so I hope part 2 talks about how to better split up the roles, because I think he&#39;s made a really good point. I&#39;ve certainly been in situations when we thought we were done the &#39;production engineering&#39; when in reality we had only really completed the design (in working code form.) We just launched it anyway and were surprised when the results were less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any Agile Programmers are reading this -- how does Cooper&#39;s article line up with your experience?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Orange Boot Week 2:  The Adventure Continues</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-2-the-adventure-continues/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/orange-boot-week-2-the-adventure-continues/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who ordered Orange Boot Bread last week. It was a great pleasure to bake for you. I know of one batch that made it to Saskatoon and another went to Calgary; I hope your bread complemented whatever Thanksgiving meal you had, wherever you had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we&#39;re introducing two new loaves which I think you&#39;ll enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g &lt;em&gt;Ciabatta:&lt;/em&gt; This is one of my favorite little loaves with a paper thin crust and amazing taste. The rustic shape makes it as visually appealing as it is tasty. ($3.00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;700g Multigrain: This complex loaf has it all - wheat bran, corn meal, oats and even some brown rice. A little honey and brown sugar provide a touch of sweetness too. This loaf makes the best toast ever! ($3.50)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re back to our regular Friday bakes after the long weekend -- please order by 6PM on Wednesday by sending an email to [mark@madbaker.com](mailto:mark@madbaker.com?subject=October 12 Bread Order) or calling (306) 522-1592. Your bread will be ready for pickup between 3PM and 6PM on Friday, October 12. If you need the bread delivered I can do that after 8:00PM Friday but please call to arrange for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note: We&#39;re doing some renovations on the preparation area this week. While our contractors do great work they are a little loose on dates, which might throw a wrench into the Friday bake schedule. We&#39;ll contact you directly if there is any issue with your order.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-do-i-order/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-do-i-order/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a really good question! Since we&#39;re still in start up mode and don&#39;t have a commercial space yet, we can&#39;t offer our bread to the general public. But that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t ask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get On The &amp;quot;Order&amp;quot; List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me at [mark@madbaker.com](mailto:mark@madbaker.com?subject=Please Add Me!) and if I know you, I&#39;ll add you to our weekly email list, where we tell you about what we&#39;re baking and when it&#39;s available. If we don&#39;t know you we need to talk a bit more before I can add you to the order list, but I&#39;ll keep you on an update list so I can let you know when we&#39;re expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place an Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week I&#39;ll post the Weekly Features and bake schedule on this site as well as email it to the &amp;quot;Order&amp;quot; list. We take orders via [email](mailto:mark@madbaker.com?subject=Weekly Bread Order) or by phone [&lt;em&gt;redacted&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pickup or Delivery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your bread is available for pickup between 3:00PM and 6:00PM on bake days. We can deliver if needed after 6:30PM on bake days if you call us and arrange delivery ahead of time. There is a small charge for delivery depending on where you live (southwest is best, the rest is a little tougher.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Spam Filter Affects Local Nourishment</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/spam-filter-affects-local-nourishment/"/>
		<updated>2007-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/spam-filter-affects-local-nourishment/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I realized that a great many customers didn&#39;t receive the invitation for Thanksgiving bread that I emailed out on Saturday. My initial reaction was relief since I was starting to get worried about the lack of orders but it seems now that it was just the case that nobody knew we were open. Wow, talk about the best kept secret in town!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the problem was that I put the word &#39;Order&#39; in the subject line, or perhaps it was my sending email address. If your spam filter allows white-listing, I sure would appreciate you putting mark@madbaker.com in your &#39;allowed list.&#39; If this becomes a lingering problem I&#39;ll investigate a bulk email service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribing to this web site (using the subscription links in the sidebar) is one way to make sure you always get the latest updates from the bakery.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Turkey Trouble?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/turkey-trouble/"/>
		<updated>2007-09-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/turkey-trouble/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving is coming up quickly. If you&#39;re like me, that means a big turkey dinner with all the fixings and lots of family and friends to share in the day. But turkeys can be a challenge to cook -- why not take some of the pressure off your turkey basting by serving some fresh, hand made bread?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Boot is offering four excellent accompaniments to your Thanksgiving Dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;700g French &lt;em&gt;Boule&lt;/em&gt;: This large round loaf has a surprisingly complex flavour for a lean dough. ($3.50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500g French &lt;em&gt;Batard&lt;/em&gt;: Larger than a baguette, smaller than a boule, this torpedo shaped loaf packs all the flavour in a smaller package ($3.00)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500g Semolina Loaf &lt;em&gt;Pane Siciliano:&lt;/em&gt; Durum semolina flour and sesame seeds add extra flavour to the loaf. The &#39;S&#39; shape adds visual appeal as well! ($3.50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;700g Cheddar Chive Torpedo: Aged cheddar, fresh chives and local potatoes combine to make a loaf which is surprisingly soft and packed with flavour! ($5.00)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, our bread is made from locally milled organic flours. The dough is built over two days to extract the maximum flavour from the grain and is baked in our wood fired brick oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please order by 5PM Wednesday, October 3 for pickup or delivery on Saturday the 6th. To order, either call (306-522-1592) or [email](mailto:mark@madbaker.com?subject=October 6 Bread Order)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now autumn is here and if you want to stay active this winter it&#39;s important not to miss your local community association&#39;s registration night. No matter where you are in Regina, your community association will be having a registration night on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, September 12 at 7PM&lt;/strong&gt; Locations vary by community association -- check out your CA website or newsletter for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Bakery - What We&#39;re About</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We&#39;re About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange Boot Bakery is an aspiring micro-bakery in Regina, Saskatchewan, offering a variety of hand made loaves baked in our very own wood-fired brick oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say &amp;quot;aspiring&amp;quot; because we&#39;re in the very initial startup mode, making bread for a slowly growing group of family and friends. Our short term goals are to get our production routine down pat so we can serve more customers each week and to learn which loaves are our customers&#39; favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our medium term goal is to open a true micro-bakery where we can offer our bread to more people, even friends we haven&#39;t met yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what our size, Orange Boot Bakery is about creating the best bread you&#39;ve ever had, in a way that preserves strong connections between the ingredients, the baker and the customer. With all the changes in food technology it&#39;s tougher than ever to make good choices about what we eat. We want you to know your baker and know what you&#39;re eating, and we want to know who we&#39;re serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where We Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re at 2904 Wascana Street in Regina, Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I figure out &#39;embedding&#39; a little better, here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;ttype=&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=103963050125733175568.00043bae13f1ecd837527&amp;amp;ll=50.436516,-104.636793&amp;amp;spn=0.023125,0.05682&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;om=1&quot;&gt;link to a map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing this post from the waiting area in the Victoria airport. Anothe sunny calm morning - I&#39;m going to miss these excellent mornings...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great trip. Great sites, super adventures and really, really relaxing. Vancouver Island has a lot to offer, and the laid back attitude is a very important part of life here. We&#39;re going to do everything we can to bring this attitude back to Regina. We&#39;ve been blessed with very livable cities here - cities that remain about people rather than cars. I&#39;m ready to recommit to moving Regina further in this direction - whether that&#39;s local markets, bike lanes, or better public transportation. I don&#39;t want to move, but I don&#39;t want to have to drive everywhere either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s see how this new mood holds up when I go to work tomorrow...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been out of &#39;net coverage for a while now - camping at French Beach and checking out the beaches and marine life at Botany Bay, Botanical Beach and China Beach. But today we&#39;re back in Victoria and that can only mean one thing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOCCER!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 4 hours till kickoff of today&#39;s U20 world cup matches. I&#39;m extremely excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve heard lots of horror stories about secutiry - long lines, no food or drink allowed in , no re-entry (and we&#39;ll be there for 5-6 hours). But, we&#39;re bringing lots of cash and sun hats. It was good to have the notice though- there was nothing in the tickets that mentioned this. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full report to follow!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So today&#39;s my birthday and the kids decided that we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; head off to the bungy zone park. No, I wasn&#39;t going bungy jumping, but we were going to try out the new rage, &amp;quot;TreeGo.&amp;quot; Basically, you get all harnessed up and run around the forest going through an obstacle course. Oh yeah, and you&#39;re in the air the whole time. Way up. Like 60 feet up. Crikey...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually quite a bit of fun, even though I&#39;m extremely scared of heights. There were some awesome zip lines that went way over 100 feet, some rock walls up in the trees, and all sorts of swinging bridges, board walks, ladders, etc. I didn&#39;t like the swinging logs much at all, but the rest was pretty decent. Although I need to confess that Cindy and the kids went significantly further than I did. That&#39;s OK, we all had fun and now I know who to get to roof the house later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to John and the folks at Wild Play in Nanaimo for a really fun afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hanging at the Hostel</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we get tired of life in the tent we&#39;ve fallen into the habit of staying in hostels. It&#39;s a good way to meet new people, save money on food (they all have kitchens) and save some money while sleeping in a warm bed. Right now we&#39;re hanging out at the Painted Turtle hostel in Nanaimo and it&#39;s the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re full up tonight due to the holiday weekend and there are some really great folks here. James from Australia is showing his DVD of his own personal version of Stupid Human Tricks. That James is a crazy guy. Seems to enjoy jumping off stuff with a bucket on his head. Over supper a few folks started a really wild singalong too accompany the cooks. Sweet. Cindy and Robyn bought me a birthday cake big enough to share which doesn&#39;t hurt either :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a fun place to stay in Nanaimo, this is it. Come check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Return to Nanaimo:  It&#39;s better already</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/return-to-nanaimo-it-s-better-already/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/return-to-nanaimo-it-s-better-already/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We took two ferries to get from Seshelt to Nanaimo -- up at 4:30AM to make it happen too. The early morning was due in part to the fear of long holiday lineups at the Horsehoe Bay ferry terminal. So we beat the traffic by getting there at 7AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks back I wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/nanaimo-just-keep-driving/&quot;&gt;my first impressions of Nanaimo&lt;/a&gt; and frankly, they weren&#39;t very good. I had a couple folks comment that I missed all the good bits and made some suggestions on how to improve things. This time round I did a couple things differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the ferry ride over, I reviewed the comments from Mindi, Tratz and Jeff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First place we went was the visitor centre for a better map of the city. Nanaimo has a large number of streets that change names for no apparent reason, so it can be a little confusing to get around at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second thing we did was drive to the harbour and PARK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say that the harbour area of Nanaimo looks a lot better on foot. Earlier I bemoaned the lack of decent restaurants -- we really enjoyed the floating Mexican restaurant right on the harbour that I&#39;m sure we drove past the first time without spotting. We also found 3-4 other places we&#39;ll be checking out this weekend. It looks like a really friendly downtown to travel on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a spin out to the Nanaimo Aquatic Centre for a great swim and soak -- it&#39;s an excellent facility and we&#39;ll be going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hosts for the weekend are the excellent folks at the Painted Turtle Guesthouse and Hostel. it&#39;s a neat little place -- clean rooms, well lit common area (if a little small) and really friendly people. Looks like we&#39;re in for a great Canada Day weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We went on a three hour sea kayaking tour yesterday along Porpoise Bay. What a great time! Although I admit I felt a little like that wooden model canoe from the children&#39;s cartoon at the start. A wee bit tippy and tough to steer. After a couple minutes though it was smooth going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a lot of wildlife - bald eagles mostly, but the highlight was a pair of seals who kept bobbing up right beside the kayaks, checking us out then diving down for a while. Quite a treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went over to a marine park where we could camp overnight if we wanted. Lots of tide pools and starfish there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayaking is a pile of fun. I can see myself buying a &amp;quot;lake&amp;quot; kayak when I get home. Very peaceful and fun way to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Written Sunday, but I just got in range to post now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather boring day. We&#39;re at the end of the line on highway 101 and we&#39;re bored. Tired of being wet. Tired of the mosquitos that come out when it stops raining. Most especially tired of trying to get a fire going with wet wood - but by jiminy, I got it going...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a wet sock in the ditch beside my campsite, which pretty much sums up the highlights of Okeover Arm Provincial Park. Thought it might be fun to see it go up in flames. No such luck. It just sat there and steamed till it turned into a sock shaped piece of black ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Okeover is Finnish for that part of the arm to which deodorant is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re moving on tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This may well be the best bakery I&#39;ve ever been to. The bread is good but not the best (Christies in Saskatoon is still #1) but the pastries, the lunches, the friendly staff and the amazing views are unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it crazy to drive 50km down a somewhat paved, very twisty road to visit a bakery, but this one is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as good as the Okeover campground is bad. Helln it&#39;s even better, and that&#39;s saying something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some pics but they will need to wait till I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We took a couple days off from the tent and headed for Courtney and Comox. Good thing too because it rained harder then ever on Saturday. But we were hanging out at the pool at the Best Western.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first impression of Courtney isn&#39;t pretty. Block after block of big boxes - the same concrete and stores as any other North American city of over 50,000 people. Why oh why do people want this? Why oh why do they want to do this to SW Regina now too??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news, however, is that they citizens of Courtney have been able to preserve their downtown. It&#39;s only six blocks, but it&#39;s lovely. Narrow streets, interesting shops, bakeries, restaurants, sporting goods, library, museum and art gallery. Sweet! We spend several hours (and more than a few dollars) in downtown Courtney and loved every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we&#39;re off to Powell River on the mainland - just about ready to board the ferry - see you on the other side!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ucluelet is my kind of town</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/ucluelet-is-my-kind-of-town/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/ucluelet-is-my-kind-of-town/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, when it was just cloudy, we headed into Ucluelet to see what that town was like. Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Ucluelet is a delightful little town - exactly what I was hoping for. Even though they cater to tourists, it&#39;s a working town, so I really got the sense we were going to places where local folks shopped. The Ambroisia Bakery was a good example of this - a basic little bakery with decent bread, cookies and muffins at reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three highlights to the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3 Ukee Dogs eatery. This is the coolest little place- part of village square which is really just a hodge podge of the cool little buildings all stacked together. Simply wonderful. And they serve great hot dogs and excellent meat pies. Best lunch yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 the Crow&#39;s Nest. A wonderful old store that claims to offer stationary, books and gifts. That sells it short. The Crow&#39;s Nest is bursting at the seams with curiosities of ll kinds. R-rated soaps. Rude cocktail napkins. Journals, candies and yes, stationary and books. All done with style. Just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1  Word End Booksellers. This small shop next to Ukee Dog is a coffee shop, a bookstore (new and used) and a bit of a curiosity shoppe too. It gets the #1 spot thanks to a delightful woman who was working there. We had a great visit that, had it gone on any longer, would&#39;ve required some chairs and a break for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do make a difference and the friendliness from everyone we met in Ucluelet made our day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - I&#39;d catch it from Cindy if I didn&#39;t add the wonderful lady at Inner Rythm Surf Shop. Another great experience (but more on that tomorrow)&lt;/p&gt;

There aren&#39;t any real raindrops falling; just a persistent drizzle that soaks you just like a thunderstorm. So we&#39;re snug and dry but don&#39;t have the usual noise.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Great day on the Pacific Rim today. It&#39;s been cold and cloudy every day and today was no exception, until about 1PM when the skies cleared, the sun shone and it warmed up quite a bit. By 2PM we had picked up a couple boogie boards and were off to the beach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach is without a doubt the nicest natural beach I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s got to be at least a mile of clear, clean sand, shallow (and kinda warm) water and great waves. Over to out left are massive rocks which are great fun to climb so long as you stay back from the water (crashing waves could kill you or at least mess you up.) On the other side of the rocks is another beach, in case the 25 people on Long Beach cramp your style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids body surfed for at least 3 hours while I walked about, swam about, laid about and finished my book.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, our kids were the only ones brave enough to actually swim - I guess it&#39;s still cold for some. But they had a great time and so did I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Book #1 of the trip is &amp;quot;Twenty Two Foreigners in Funny Shorts - the Intelligent Fan&#39;s Guide to the World Cup&amp;quot; by Pete Davies. It&#39;s about my fifth reading but I still enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tofino:  beautiful, busy and really expensive</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re in Tofino for a couple days and are trying to figure out what to do. We went whale watching yesterday (more on that later) and any other big adventure here is going to hit our budget pretty hard. One thing that&#39;s getting cut is a trip to a nearby hot springs. Looks great, but it&#39;s 1.5 hours one way by boat. Sounds like fun, but that translates to 400 dollars for the family to go. That&#39;s a lot of coin for a soak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, we still haven&#39;t figured out how to have a shower here. Heard a rumour that the laundromat in town might have showers too. Otherwise I might just have to shave my head. That or get some dreadlocks going.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Arrived at Pacific Rim National Park</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/arrived-at-pacific-rim-national-park/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had a nice drive over the mountains to Pacific Rim park this afternoon. Opted to stay at the national park rather than Tofino - the sites are bigger, more secluded and cheaper. No showers though - it&#39;ll be 8 days minimum between showers at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re getting exposed to the crowds that are attracted to the island already. We can only stay till Friday since the campground is booked solid on Friday, and the hostel is full on Saturday too. In the Maritimes we didn&#39;t have issues till August so having this happen so soon is a surprise. We therefore decided to take an hour and map out the trip in a little more detail and start making some reservations. Second draft looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tofino till Friday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;head to Comox and a motel to shower and chill&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Horne Lake Caves - fun with Kate and Nate</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/horne-lake-caves-fun-with-kate-and-nate/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It rained all night, so we were more than a little apprehensive this morning. Last night I signed up for four tickets for the three hour &amp;quot;Adventure tour&amp;quot; and agreed twice that there was no possible way I&#39;d ever get a refund. The guide said the park was at the end of an active logging road, whichwas scary enough without the wet conditions (in 2004 I burnt out my brakes descending a logging road at Cody Caves near Nelson BC.) But we gritted our teeth and went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, this was a very wide, tame logging road and we arrived early and without incident. We were greeted by our guides Kate and Nate and joined up with 4 other spelunkers. They gave us some helmets and lights - the helmet came in handy several times - and we began a 1km hike to the Riverbend Cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverbend was fantastic. We learned about how the crystals formed over thousands of years, and how they could be destroyed by touching them (our oily hands stain them grey and stop the formations from growing). Riverbend is only accessible via a guided hike and we were grateful to have the chance to go through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all we toured three caves. This was not your overdeveloped cave with lights and handrails - we were scrambling over and under huge limestone boulders, squeezing through cracks and stepping across underground rivers. It was a good workout and a little spooky at times. But the whole experience was absolutely exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two other caves allow self guided tours but I really recommend signing up for the guided tour. Kate and Nate were experienced, knowledgeable and helpful. I wouldn&#39;t know where to start if I was on my own. Well worth the expense, and horne Lake caves is well worth the effort to check out. Go There!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Changing of the Guard</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/changing-of-the-guard/"/>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/changing-of-the-guard/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Iwas reflecting on our adventure at Horne Lake Caves today and a flood of old memories came to me all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first real thing Cindy and I bought as a couple was our tent. It was 1990 if I recall, before we even got married. We&#39;ll be sleeping in it tonight. In &#39;93 we bought our van, and although we&#39;re not using the van on this trip we&#39;ve had some wild adventures in it and there are still a few camping trips left in it, for sure. The packs we use were wedding gifts, which makes this 15 years of faithful service and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took Ben on his first camp trip when he was two weeks old, and Robyn had her first night in the tent at four months. Since then we&#39;ve camped through seven provinces and have probably spent over 100 night in our tent on mountains, lakes, prairie, ocean beaches and the Canadian Shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve watched the kids grow up on these trips. They were 2 and 3 when we had a bear come through the campsite in Waskisieu. 4 and 5 when we tried to hike Mt Indefatigable in Kananaskis. 7 and 9 when we went caving for the first time in Nelson. And 8 and 10 when we went body surfing off the coast of PEI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all those great adventures, and all the other hikes and tours we&#39;ve taken, we were always looking out for the kids, making sure they could push their boundaries but stopping before they went too far outside their comfort zone. All that changed today. For the first time,the parents, we, Cindy and I, or honestly, me. I was the constraint. The kids never had an issue at any stage of the cave tour, but there were a couple spots where I wasn&#39;t sure if I could muster up the courage to squeeze myself through a particularly tight spot. Or if my knees could bend and twist that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a scary time for a while, to think that I&#39;m soon going to be the one told hold us up. But right now I just feel proud or the kids - proud of all they&#39;ve done, and tried, and learned. They&#39;re eager to try things that give me pause, they try it, and they do well and enjoy themselveso. Who could ask for more than that?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Englishman River Falls:  great hike, great sites, wrong turn</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/englishman-river-falls-great-hike-great-sites-wrong-turn/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/englishman-river-falls-great-hike-great-sites-wrong-turn/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another cool morning, so we decided to check out the Englishman River Falls hike, which starts right near our campsite. It was a beautiful stroll through a stand of huge fir and hemlock trees. They were massive, straight and covered in moss. The trail was empty but for the four of us, we were able to take in the deep silence of the forest, with the sound of water rushing far in the distance. Some trees had fallen over winter and huge sections were sawed out to clear the trail. But that still left at least 50 feet of straight timber on either side of the trail. We really felt like we were walking through the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park Ranger told us to take the left fork for an easier hike (steep descent vs steep climb) so when we found a side trailwe took a close look then went for it. After a while we started to get concerned. The trail dropped very steeply and there were more and more fallen trees blocking the path. In other words, it looked less and less like a trail the further we went. Finally we were faced with a scramble down a really steep bank. Cindy decided to check things out ahead - she made it to the river, but there was no bridge in site. So we clambered back to the main trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usually happens with us, we found the real fork less than 50m further ahead, complete with concrete steps and handrails. The path took us to the lower falls, which were very nice, but the coolest part was the deep blue pool carved out of sandstone directly below the falls. It would make a great swimming hole on a hot day. Unfortunately for Robyn it was cool and drizzly but she still got in up to her ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper falls were much more spectacular - a wide, shallow river turns sharply left, narrows and drops 50m into a tight gorge. A bridge takes you right over the drop so you can see some of the massive trunks which are jammed in the gorge. Quite specactular.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Nanaimo: just keep driving</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/nanaimo-just-keep-driving/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/nanaimo-just-keep-driving/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We left Victoria this morning to head for the wilderness. Or at least Englishman River Falls provincial park. it&#39;s a very pretty campground with some very, very large trees and on this day it&#39;s almost completely empty. We had our choice of nearly 125 sites before we settled on #87.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped in Nanaimo for some of the most expensive groceries ever and tried to stop for lunch too. After an hour of driving around we just moved on. It seems downtown is completely derelict (they&#39;re building a big casino to spruce things up I assume) and the outer ring is the same fast food chains you&#39;d find in any other town. Not a local diner to be found, unless you count the one with three drunks slumped in front of the door. That&#39;s not exactly &amp;quot;family dining&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the campground we met a fellow with two of the biggest dogs we&#39;ve ever seen. A Great Dane and Italian Mastiff. Small horses, actually. The mastiff was originally bread to battle lions in the roman colesium. I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Tratz comments that we missed the good bits and North Nanaimo is quite nice. We&#39;ll check it out on the return leg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE #2: OK, &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/return-to-nanaimo-its-better-already/&quot;&gt;I stand corrected&lt;/a&gt;. Once you park and start walking around, it turns out that Nanaimo is a wonderful place. Thanks to the Jeff, Tratz and Mindi for commenting. I wouldn&#39;t have tried it without you!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Someone call Frommers!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/someone-call-frommers/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/someone-call-frommers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just had a wild 40 minutes at the &amp;quot;under the sea adventure&amp;quot; in Victoria&#39;s inner harbour. It was recommended in our usually spot-on Frommers guidebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking onto what appears to be a small houseboat and ponying up 30 bucks, we descend a long dimly lit staircase to the undersea &amp;quot;natural acquarium&amp;quot; where we can see all kinds of fish and sea creatures. At the top of the hour, a scuba guy goes into the tank to show us some of the tough to see sea creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Frommers doesn&#39;t mention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the water is so murkey it&#39;s tough to see many of the fish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rockfish don&#39;t really move much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;re entertained by &amp;quot;Baby Beluga&amp;quot; and the entire Raffi song collection on the PA system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The poster about the scuba guy is a drawing of a giant octopus which is twice as large as the human, with &amp;quot;Descent Under The Sea&amp;quot; in evil red letters. The voiceover of the scuba guy (I should really call him Matt) is one of these James Earl Jones types, talking about how Threatening and Untamed the sea has been to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the actual octopus is about 2 feet long and the wolf eel (drawn as scary as Satan himself on the poster) is described as the friendliest fish in the tank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was cheesy. Really cheesy. True to form, the kids liked it, but the owners could really do with updating their presentation. And cleaning the tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Frommers redeemed:  Royal BC Museum is Excellent</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/frommers-redeemed-royal-bc-museum-is-excellent/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/frommers-redeemed-royal-bc-museum-is-excellent/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Royal BC Museum, nestled between the legislature and the Empress Hotel, is an excellent destination for people wanting to learn more about Vancouver Island and the West Coast of Canada. The first level describes the natural history, focusing on the coastal wildlife (from grizzlys to elk to sea lions) and ocean life (from sea stars to sea cucumbers to the ever popular rockfish) There&#39;s even a full size Wolly Mammoth that&#39;s, well, mammoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second level is dedicated to a superb account of west coast native culture and history, both before and after European contact. It was wonderful and I lingered over the displays till the kids couldn&#39;t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The native culture exhibit was a big contrast to the tour of the legislative building across the street, which never mentions ANY culture in BC other than British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal BC Museum is easily my second favorite museum in Canada, behind only our own Royal Saskatchewan. And at 43 dollars admission vs free in Regina, we&#39;re still the best value.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Great start for Canada at Gold Cup</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/great-start-for-canada-at-gold-cup/"/>
		<updated>2007-06-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/great-start-for-canada-at-gold-cup/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, I&#39;m only posting this to draw your attention to the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://footiefool.com/&quot;&gt;Footie Fool&lt;/a&gt; blog. It&#39;s fantastic -- he follows Canadian soccer better than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, did you catch the match last night? What a stunner. Costa Rica played really well in Germany last year so I didn&#39;t expect much from Canada. Once Costa Rica went up 1-0 I figured that was it, so what do we do? Just go down and get &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; goals back! In the last 10 minutes (plus an unbearable four minutes of injury time) the Canadians carried the play and had several chances for a third goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://footiefool.com/2007/06/07/savouring-the-victory-canada-stuns-costa-rica-2-1-in-gold-cup-opener/&quot;&gt;tape delay problems&lt;/a&gt; like the folks in Victoria, but I did have the challenge of two kids wanting hockey updates and a dog that was aggressively playful. As a result I missed &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Canadian goals. Unbelievable. Not even a replay. Sat through three hours of Stanley Cup post-game and still didn&#39;t see anything. Anyone have a link to some highlights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing thought: In Mr. Fools review of the match he pines for some better announcers for the next Gold Cup broadcast. Agreed! They actually read out the names and numbers of each starting player. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the deal with North American non-latin announcers hyper-embellishing all the spanish names, anyway? British announcers seem to be OK with calling Ronaldo, well, Ronaldo. No need to roll every R, A, O and sometimes D. By the time this guy finished saying Jose Francisco Porras after a save, the Costa Rican keeper had got up (jose), found the ball (francisco) and sent it back down the pitch (porrrrrras.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a winter bus rider and one of the things that bugs me is how tough it is to get transit information. Yes, our city transit authority has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reginatransit.com/&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; but it&#39;s touch to navigate, with a user interface that was poor in 2002, let alone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today I read that Google Maps has expanded to offer transit information as part of their mapping service. If your transit organization &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.htm&quot;&gt;submits the data&lt;/a&gt;, bus stops and stop times will be displayed on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll notify the appropriate authorities and am just jiggly with anticipation...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Well, it was harder than I thought to leave a comment on the Regina Transit site but it&#39;s done. If you&#39;ve got some time on your hands, check out the &#39;contact us&#39; process &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reginatransit.com/1_Rts_contact_us.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which sends you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reginatransit.com/1_Rts_contact_us.html#5&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regina.ca/citycentralrequests.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=&quot;http://66.179.23.21/DP1/Metroplex/Regina//customerservice/starthere.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (three screens of info to fill in including manditory country and home phone number fields!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just sent off my letter of support to Grow Regina, who are working with the City to establish a new community garden in Lakeview. It&#39;ll be in what&#39;s known as Macleod Park, which is on Queen Street just south of Hill Avenue. It&#39;ll be a great addition to the community -- can&#39;t argue with more vegetables, and hopefully they&#39;ll get a nice mix of young and old folks out to tend their plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people expressed support for the plan at an open house in conjunction with the Lakeview CA fall registration night. Hopefully the approvals happen soon and the garden is ready by spring 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on taking a plot out -- I might finally get some decent potatoes and corn going. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, I&#39;m taking the day off in celebration of receiving my first ever blog comment from a &amp;quot;stranger.&amp;quot; And &lt;a href=&quot;http://footiefool.com/&quot;&gt;Footie Fool&lt;/a&gt; has been added to my Feed list too. Thanks for the comment and I&#39;m looking forward to digging through your site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the update: I spent the better part of yesterday bragging to my coworkers about scoring U20 world cup tickets on July 7 in Victoria. Once I spent a couple minutes explaining what the tournament was all about and that Canada was the host nation and yes it was legitimate, they were excited too. I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though soccer is becoming more mainstream, comparisons to the world junior hockey or curling championships are still required here on the flatlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For added enjoyment, try telling your friends (in an excited voice) that you&#39;re going to see Uruguay-Zambia and Japan-Nigeria. Take a picture of their discomfort and then watch them relax when you explain that three of the four teams are borderline regulars in the &#39;senior&#39; world cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s OK, they&#39;re trying. In 1998 I actually got teased when I let on I was taping and watching all the world cup matches from France. &amp;quot;What, are you waiting for a goal or something?&amp;quot; Har Har. Things are much better now...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m expecting big things in Victoria. Maybe not dancing in the streets, but flags and horns perhaps? Maybe I can pick up a Zambia scarf or rising sun headband? That would be way cool.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I promise that this site won&#39;t just break down the City of Regina site (unless you like that sort of thing) but I just noticed that you can check the web site to see whether your soccer field or ball diamond got rained out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real link, since they just slam the info on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://regina.ca/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; (look for the header of Athletic Fields) so you&#39;ll have to check back, but they did publish a phone number. So now I will too: (306) 777-7484.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Insider Tip #1:  Central Scheduling</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/insider-tip-1-central-scheduling/"/>
		<updated>2007-05-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/insider-tip-1-central-scheduling/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m learning a lot today. For example, I just posted the phone number if you want to check if your ball diamond / field is rained out. Well it&#39;s the same number as Central Scheduling: the place you call if you want to book any city facility, neighbourhood centre, school gymnasium, ice rink, ditch, culvert or patch of grass. Have you ever been there? I have and it&#39;s not pretty. 2-3 frazzled looking (but very nice) people up to their eyes in application forms, phones ringing off the hook, etc. Nicest people you&#39;ve ever met, but wow are they busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s my first tip (maybe in a series if I figure out more) of how to make your interactions with the City as easy as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t call to book something if it&#39;s raining. Wait for a nice day, preferably after lunch when you&#39;re confident the weather will hold till evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don&#39;t call in June either. They just got 1000+ ice rink applications in the mail from hockey, ringette, figure skating, power skating and community people trying to claim a small piece of our eight (8) hockey rinks. If the others applicants are like me, the schedulers are then dealing with innumerable phone calls from people trying to change dates and times in February of the following year. (hey -- you try to think about power skating when it&#39;s +25 outside!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Sunny days, not in June. You&#39;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus Tip: If you go in person (they&#39;re in a small room at the Fieldhouse), make sure to smile. They&#39;re really nice folks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I was building out the links (psst: over there, on the right sidebar --&amp;gt; ) I stumbled across a wacky banner on the City of Regina web site. Turns out they&#39;ve launched a service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regina.ca/content/business/bizpal/bizpal.shtml&quot;&gt;BizPal.&lt;/a&gt; It appears to be a wizard to guide you through the complex but very important processes involved in obtaining a business permit or license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While digging around a little it seems to be a &#39;national&#39; app. I can get a license in the Yukon if I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might take a while to find on the city site but the link above takes you right to the wizard. Now stop selling those muffins door to door and go get legal!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m starting to get into the new MLS football team &lt;a href=&quot;http://toronto.fc.mlsnet.com/t280/&quot;&gt;Toronto FC&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve seen two games now; their first ever win and their first away points (2-2 at Columbus.) Now, that&#39;s on TV of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBC is showing games and they are pretty good. Small stadiums = low camera angles so you get right on the field. CBC has a British guy doing play-by-play so it sounds authentic, and Craig Forrest does a really good job as colour commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of play is pretty good, although nothing like the better European Leagues. The MLS guys get pretty gassed after an hour and it shows. I watched Arsenal - Bolton on tape right after the MLS game and there was a huge difference in the pace of play and shot velocity. But the MLS game is entertaining nontheless. Toronto is getting a lot of fans out to the games so there is some excitement to the games. I think it will last -- I sure hope so anyway. 2-3 more Canadian teams would be nice. Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa? How about Edmonton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenal is still my #1 team, but now I&#39;ll be following Welsh, Cunningham and Dichyo too!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post of Big Creek News. I&#39;ll gussy up the site a bit over the next couple days but I want to focus on content for a while first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this site exist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple version: I&#39;ve lived in Regina, Saskatchewan my entire life and in South Regina since around 1992. Most of my friends growing up have left the city, since &amp;quot;there&#39;s nothing going on in Regina.&amp;quot; That&#39;s hogwash! Whether you&#39;re 8 or 88, there are more things to do in this lovely city than hours in the day. What&#39;s missing is a place to learn what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex version: More to come over time. Suffice to say I hope we can share all the good things that our going on in town. I hope we can discuss the unpleasant things that go on in town as well, with an eye to working through issues. I think the term for this is &#39;Building Community&#39;, but I&#39;m not very precise with the Big Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

I got online and am now the proud owner of 4 tickets to the July 7 matches. We&#39;ll get to see Uruguay vs. Zambia and Japan vs. Nigeria. Should be great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s very unlikely that we&#39;ll be going to the 2010 Olympics so this is the closest thing to a world class sporting event I&#39;ll get to see. I&#39;m very excited.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got to post some pictures soon (sorry!) but I had to shout out. My Brick Oven is now a Bread Oven! Yippee!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fired up the oven on Sunday and baked three batches of bread: some french loaves, semolina bread and seven grain bread. It was quite the adventure since I had no idea how long it was going to take to fire the oven so I mis-timed the dough pretty badly. Cooler oven than I&#39;d like and over-risen dough but you know what, it was great fun and the bread tasted pretty good too. No complaints from my co-workers, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun working with larger quantities -- in the end I baked 28 700g loaves, a big pan of granola and even baked off our supper. A very long day but very exhilirating. I can hardly wait for the next baking day!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>On Making Better Connections</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/on-making-better-connections/"/>
		<updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/on-making-better-connections/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/701-6526145-8745909?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1175538082&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Never Eat Alone&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Ferrazzi. I picked it up because I struggle whenever I&#39;m at &#39;networking&#39; type events. I&#39;m not exactly shy, although that&#39;s part of the struggle, but I do have a tough time engaging in conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author takes his &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot; activities to an extreme; although he warns against becoming someone who is driven to do nothing but expand his Rolodex he seems to come pretty darn close to the line. However, there were two good takeaways for me to work on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on helping others: Finding how you can help is easier than worrying about how others can help you. If you&#39;re helpful to others, you will get help when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a &#39;Network Action Plan&#39; for every major project you are involved in. That is, look for ways to get people in your network engaged and involved in your projects. Engaging your network is an important part of successful projects, and your Network Action Plan is a key piece of your Project Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to improve in how I recruit people to join in my community projects. Heck, recruiting one person would be an improvement. I&#39;m going to try looking for how I can help others through the community association to see if that helps get some reciprocation down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Question: How do you recruit people to help on projects you think are important?&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/37signals-com-cool-software-great-marketing-amazing-product-development/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been blown away by a new (for me) discovery of a software company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt;. They offer project management, contact management and other software all &#39;as a service&#39; -- you sign up online and start using it automatically, without any downloads or client software to install. Their latest offering is a contact management application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highrisehq.com/&quot;&gt;Highrise&lt;/a&gt; which launched a couple weeks back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com/svn/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; as well, and here&#39;s an excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/332-highrise-early-stats-cases-for-all-the-new-solo-plan-and-more-disk-space&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; which stopped me in my tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you It’s been just over 36 hours since we officially launched Tuesday afternoon. We’ve been overwhelmed by the response. All things considered, the launch of Highrise has been our most successful product launch ever. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some early stats Highrise is definitely getting a workout. Here are some early stats on the amount of data that has been added to the system so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 150,000 contacts Over 15,000 notes Over 10,000 tasks Another interesting stat is that 9% of the people signed up are using OpenID. Lots of early adopters on board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard you: Here come Cases for everyone When we launched we only offered Cases on Plus, Premium, and Max plans. There was a fair bit of negative reaction to that decision. We hear you. So today we’ve made a change. Now all plans include some Cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on to explain how, based on feedback, they are changing the storage pricing; also, how to get a credit if a customer &#39;over-bought&#39; based on the original pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;36 hours old 150,000 contacts entered Already have enough feedback to tweak the service packaging Already decided to tweak the packaging Already have a process to switch plans based on the packaging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you kidding me? My employer couldn&#39;t do this in 36 days, let alone 36 hours. This is one of the most amazing things I&#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility matters.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Working &#39;On&#39; Your Business - The E-Myth Revisited</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/working-on-your-business-the-e-myth-revisited/"/>
		<updated>2007-03-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/working-on-your-business-the-e-myth-revisited/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished a pretty decent book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3599585-2448046?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1173843478&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;The E-Myth Revisited&lt;/a&gt; by Michael E. Gerber. It helped me get my head around some misconceptions I had about running a small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author really pushes building your business as if it is a prototype for a franchise, regardless of whether you will ever spin it off into a franchise. By doing this, you are in effect documenting every important feature, process and procedure of your business so that you could sell the rights to someone else and they could operate it turn-key. And if everything is so well defined you could sell it turn-key, then at the very least you could hand off enough of the duties to take a vacation once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key quote: You need to spend more time working &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your business instead of working &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the book was a bit of a fluke - I had seen the title at the bookstore for quite a long time and always figured it was a dot-bomb retrospective. But a while back I picked it up and flipped to a section when the author is describing a woman running a pie shop. It sounded close enough to a bakery for me, so I read on and finally picked up a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside for me was that most of the book is written as a parable (a la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Wealthy-Barber-Updated-3rd-Commonsense/dp/0761513116/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3599585-2448046?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1173844097&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;The Wealthy Barber&lt;/a&gt;) which wears thin quickly -- the author likes monologuing too much for that format. But it&#39;s pretty good nonetheless. Well worth picking up at the library.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/03/good_is_not_alm.html&quot;&gt;visit to a car dealership&lt;/a&gt; to show that there is a very wide gulf indeed between a &#39;good&#39; salesperson and a &#39;great&#39; salesperson. I&#39;ve been either working in a sales organization, or supporting our sales organization for three years now and I second Seth&#39;s observations -- it&#39;s too easy to settle for &#39;good enough.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a roundabout way, Seth also points to some of the contributing factors which allow &#39;good enough&#39; to occur. In my case, our sales force has been selected more to retain existing revenues over growing new sales; it&#39;s part of the deal when you&#39;re the incumbent and you&#39;re protecting your base. But our sales compensation is so skewed toward guaranteed salary (and everyone making the same salary) that there&#39;s no real incentive to significantly grow business. Growing business means forging new relationships and that&#39;s riskier than working within your existing customer base. But if you&#39;re not growing, you&#39;re shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corollary to Seth&#39;s argument is: If you don&#39;t pay the best, and let &#39;good enough&#39; work for your competition, your &#39;best&#39; will eventually be working for your competition.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My post rate has been abysmal. I&#39;m still adding to my list of things to blog about without actually blogging, which kind of defeats the purpose. Thanks to my readers (both of you) for sticking with me during the lean time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I&#39;ve been reading a tonne! 6 book plus several thousand blog posts in the last month. I&#39;m using Google Reader to aggregate everything and they have an excellent &#39;share&#39; feature. Check out the &amp;quot;I&#39;m Reading&amp;quot; section in the sidebar for the recent posts I&#39;ve read that are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re also worth commenting on, which is something I need to do more of. Starting tonight!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;version 7 or so of my about page.&lt;/em&gt;)
My name is Mark Dyck and I live in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still figuring out what to blog about; I&#39;ve got lots of interests and no clear focus. So you could read about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brick oven bread baking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minor hockey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web 2.0 tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blogs, social media, wikis and the like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citizen media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better powerpoint presentations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting and growing a small business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend towards thinking too much and writing too little; switching that around is my top priority!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Original Music for Internet Video</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/original-music-for-internet-video/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/original-music-for-internet-video/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been mesmerized by several really good online videos lately. They are visually stunning but I realize now that I&#39;m attracted to the music as much as anything -- original music which really matches the tempo of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a big New Order fan in the 80&#39;s so perhaps this is a throwback to New Age music but there&#39;s something new to it as well. For one, I find it a lot more soothing and inspiring. Music for Web 2.0? Music for the last half of the &#39;00s? I don&#39;t know what to call it, but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s three examples of incredible videos which are made even better by the music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: I saw this video about to transition from text to hypertext to xml to Web 2.0 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/02/this_is_what_im.html&quot;&gt;Chris Anderson&#39;s Long Tail Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot;&gt; &lt;lite-youtube videoid=&quot;6gmP4nk0EOE&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6gmP4nk0EOE/hqdefault.jpg&#39;);&quot;&gt;
&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;lty-playbtn&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lyt-visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/lite-youtube&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Here&#39;s a great take-off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/01/an_examination_.html&quot;&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; presentations, which I first saw over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com/&quot;&gt;Presentation Zen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot;&gt; &lt;lite-youtube videoid=&quot;lWWKBY7gx_0&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lWWKBY7gx_0/hqdefault.jpg&#39;);&quot;&gt;
&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;lty-playbtn&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lyt-visually-hidden&quot;&gt;Le Grand Content&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/lite-youtube&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3: Another from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com/&quot;&gt;Presentation Zen&lt;/a&gt; which links to a video on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/01/can_i_trust_you.html&quot;&gt;Trusted Computing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;alas, the video was deleted sometime between 2007 and 2023&lt;/em&gt; 😕)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool Tunes or what?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Problem of Anonymity</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-problem-of-anonymity/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-problem-of-anonymity/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My airplane reading this for this trip is a book I&#39;ve wanted to read for a few months now: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Small-New-Big-Remarkable-Business/dp/1591841267/sr=8-1/qid=1170812590/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0583919-5916951?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;Small is the New Big&lt;/a&gt; by Seth Godin. It&#39;s a collection of &#39;the best&#39; of his blog posts over the past 3-4 years. While I spend a lot of time reading online I still appreciate holding some paper in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He riffs on the troubles associated with anonymity on the internet. Seth&#39;s against it. Says it causes a ton of problems, not least of which are spam, flame wars, trolls and general bitchiness. My favorite line:&amp;quot;anonymity is the enemy of civility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I completely agree. When I started this blog I thought about writing under a pseudonym or leaving my blog completely anonymous. But within a week of my first post I read two blogs by people I know in Regina and i was appalled by how cranky the blogs were. Not really the tone (not my style, but that&#39;s OK), but more that they didn&#39;t have the guts to put their name behind what they were writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question: who do you respect/admire more, someone who anonymously puts up a web page criticizing local government, or some kids who recorded a song criticizing local government (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/rahrahband&quot;&gt;click &#39;ode to Pasquala&#39;&lt;/a&gt;) and perform it live on stage all over the city no matter who attends?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Regional Airlines and the Classless Society</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/regional-airlines-and-the-classless-society/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/regional-airlines-and-the-classless-society/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you live in the sticks, you get served by regional airlines. The favorite jet of the regional airline seems to be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=125&quot;&gt;Canadair CL-600&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;re sleek, they&#39;re fast and they only carry 50 people, so I assume they are fuel efficient too. Thanks for keeping my flights to under $2000 most of the time, Air Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s some real good news here. First Class? Forget about it! There&#39;s no First Class in the Regional jet. I get to rub shoulders with Captains of Industry, former football greats and former Federal politicians. But do I really have to physically rub shoulders with these people? Elbows, legs, knees and tummies too? I sat beside a guy on the way to Calgary who was at most 175 pounds and we couldn&#39;t stay &#39;disconnected&#39; for more than 30 seconds. The guy behind me (at most 220 pounds) apologized to the guy beside him (at most 6 feet tall) that they were in for a rough flight because neither of them actually fit in their seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can live with the fact that no carry-on bags can actually fit in the cabin on these planes but couldn&#39;t they make the planes even 24 inches wider for our collective buttocks? We can&#39;t all be 4&#39; 10&amp;quot; and 100 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m 5&#39; 8&amp;quot; tall with shoes on. We can all lose a few pounds, but my belt covers the widest part of my middle, if you know what I mean. But when I fly, I&#39;m a Pro-Bowl linebacker. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>On Procrastination</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/on-procrastination/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/on-procrastination/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My airplane listening (hey, it was a long flight!) was a series of podcasts by Merlin Mann at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/&quot;&gt;43folders&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidco.com/&quot;&gt;David Allen&lt;/a&gt;, the personal productivity guru and one of my heros. I stumbled across David&#39;s email newsletter back in 2001, and printed/saved them until his best seller &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/sr=8-1/qid=1170813048/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0583919-5916951?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; came out in print. Heck, GTD was my first Amazon book purchase, OK? So getting to hear the maestro for 90 minutes while cramped in a &#39;regional carrier&#39; was a thrill indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, ok, ok. Enough Dave love. What did he have to say about procrastination? Lots, actually. I was just getting around to telling you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (you? I?) procrastinate for three reasons: it&#39;s not worth doing anymore but I haven&#39;t conciously killed it yet; I don&#39;t know what the next action is (so I need to figure that out to get unstuck); or I don&#39;t feel confident that I can engage (on the item) with control and success. Zowie! That last one hit me like a ton of firebrick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! There&#39;s more! He quoted another book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437/sr=1-1/qid=1170813222/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0583919-5916951?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;War of Art&lt;/a&gt;), (he couldn&#39;t remember the author but he remembered the quote) &amp;quot;the thing that is closest to your soul is the thing that you avoid the most.&amp;quot; Not much you can do about this one, says Dave, other than be aware of it, recognize it and give yourself permission to deal with it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, this helped me out quite a bit. The toughest thing about building my brick oven was ordering materials from suppliers who knew everything about their products but nothing about ovens. I could write a whole post just about finding fireclay. In those cases it was my lack of confidence in having a successful conversation with the supplier that caused delays. The thought of being treated like a goof caused huge anxiety. In hindsight, there was more I could&#39;ve done to ensure &#39;control and success&#39; when interacting with suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately however, I&#39;ve been avoiding doing more to get the bakery going. Things like taking two weeks to spend an hour re-assembling the mixer, never chopping wood, etc. In these cases the actual task is easy. So why the delay? I think it&#39;s the last bit -- &#39;the closest to my soul.&#39; I&#39;ve still got a &#39;fear of something&#39; with regard to the bakery which I haven&#39;t identified yet. So quit trying to identify it; just recognize that I&#39;ll be nervous about it, and get going anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Meanwhile, back at home, Cindy just rolled her eyes. Karma. She gets this in her genes. I&#39;m good at other stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>GTD Podcast Wrapup</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/gtd-podcast-wrapup/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some final cool tidbits from the 43folders podcast with David Allen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-On committing to your organization process: either your head is your organization system, or it&#39;s not. David obviously recommends against using your head, but if you&#39;re going to start getting things out of your head, you&#39;ve got to get everything out. As soon as you track two items in your head you&#39;ll distrust your other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merlin Mann likes using the phrase &#39;Ninja Moves&#39; for really cool techniques. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;organization is like training kids and dogs: use as few rules as possible but never break them. HUGE head nods after everything we&#39;ve done training Buddy Dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you can&#39;t do it (organize) with paper, you can&#39;t do it with &#39;e&#39;. You&#39;re going to get paper, and you&#39;re going to get emails. if you can&#39;t deal with both you&#39;re in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one crazy, step back from the ledge thought: what if I set up my email / blackberry to only push emails every two hours? Would I get more done? &lt;em&gt;whew&lt;/em&gt; I need to sit down....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Business Travel Essentials</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/business-travel-essentials/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/business-travel-essentials/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I arrived in San Diego late Sunday afternoon and have checked in at the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laavenidainn.com/&quot;&gt;La Avenida Inn&lt;/a&gt; on Coronado Island. It&#39;s a very comfortable (and affordable) little motel which is the perfect place for my psyche. They have friendly staff, clean and spacious rooms and a top notch cable TV selection. I&#39;ve never really felt comfortable at the &#39;five star&#39; accomodations where one usually stays during business travel. I&#39;ve had my fill of Pan Pacifics in Vancouver, Fairmonts in San Francisco or even Marriotts in Minneapolis; lovely buildings with a lobby to match their high pricetag, but no real soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Avenida Inn is exactly the type of hotel I would stay in if I were travelling with my family. However there are two things missing that I now realize are Essentals when I&#39;m travelling on business. The first is an iron in the room. I don&#39;t pack very well so my shirts are creased up pretty good, but a quick steam in the bathroom should fix them well enough. The second missing item is internet access. I&#39;ve grown used to free wireless internet, but I thought every hotel in the planet at least had a for-money broadband service available. La Avenida has neither. So I&#39;ll get to spend part of each day at one of the nearby coffee shops posting to the blog. Not as &#39;live&#39; as I originally planned but I&#39;m adaptable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it&#39;s worth checking in advance for irons + internet before I book my next hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Posted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wearthebean.com/blog/coffee_shops_in_coronado_ca/&quot;&gt;Cafe 1134&lt;/a&gt; in Coronado -- worth walking to!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Heading South</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/heading-south/"/>
		<updated>2007-02-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/heading-south/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve acquired a slight head cold so that can mean only one thing -- I&#39;m heading off on an airplane! Yep, I leave Sunday for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stellentcrescendo.com/Crescendo/index.htm&quot;&gt;Stellent Crescendo&lt;/a&gt; conference. I&#39;ll be meeting with some of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://sasktel.com/business/small/managed-applications/index.html?Link=HostingMgmtServices-SMB&amp;amp;campaign=HomePage&quot;&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; customers, the Stellent sales / partner crew and hopefully learn some more about content management too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside (other than the massive sinus pain I will indoubtably suffer) is that I&#39;ll miss most of the Super Bowl. I&#39;m loading up on pre-game hype instead. My motto is the same as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/home&quot;&gt;NFL network&lt;/a&gt; -- everything but the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll blog as much as I can from the conference, but I&#39;ll have to split between internal stuff and what I can share publically. Hopefully you&#39;ll get more than descriptions of the beaches and palm trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some extra links: The conference is at the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoteldel.com/&quot;&gt;Hotel Del Coronado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be staying at the even more wonderful (for me) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laavenidainn.com/&quot;&gt;La Avenida Inn&lt;/a&gt; across the street. To be honest, I&#39;m not one for ultra-swanky accomodations and this is a great little hotel I discovered when I was here back in 2000. Clean rooms, great location and friendly staff. That&#39;s all I could ever want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a little behind in my posting on this blog since I&#39;ve been getting an internal company blog going at work. I can&#39;t link to it since it&#39;s, well, internal. Sorry.

		<title>Monday Hockey Roundup</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/monday-hockey-roundup/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/monday-hockey-roundup/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wild weekend on the minor hockey front. We kicked things off with a Regina Pats game attended by both teams which was a lot of fun, although a ticket mixup meant the two teams were on opposite sides of the arena. I got some good mileage walking back and forth to check on the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the weekend was spent with dueling ice times, but somehow everyone showed up where they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn got her second start in goal and earned her first ever shutout. She was on top of the world all night after that game, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben played well in a 5-2 loss to the Phantoms, in a game that was marred by some chippy play and some really nasty hits. The Phantoms had a large size advantage over the smaller Sharks and their coaches seemed to encourage the players to knock the pee out of everyone regardless of size. Why crush a kid when a push will do? I don&#39;t know. In the end there were 18 penalties called and one Phantom got ejected ([the irony is the ejection wasn&#39;t the worst hit of the game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think there is a place for smaller kids to play minor hockey once they turn 11 and that&#39;s very sad indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

If you use multiple computers, or just want to manage all your blog subscriptions, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader/&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; will make blog reading easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me giddy just thinking that one of my posts may one day show up on the same screen as &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt;. OK, it&#39;ll likely only be on my own reader, but I can dream, can&#39;t I?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Have you heard of this iPhone thingy?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it made the local paper but those kooky funsters at Apple have announced a new cellphony/music player/web surfer thingy. It got a little bit of press on cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I was worried that I would end up as the only blogger who didn&#39;t post about the iPhone announcement. But then I couldn&#39;t figure out how to market the fact that I didn&#39;t post about iPhone without posting about iPhone. It started to make my head hurt. I&#39;m glad that&#39;s finally been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found most interesting was how the CEO of Cingular got skewered for being such a poor presenter. I guess style matters, at least when you&#39;re on the stage with the Grand Master himself, Steve Jobs. I&#39;ll be watching my own executive&#39;s performances with a new set of filters from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/&quot;&gt;iPhone announcement&lt;/a&gt; (Apple.com)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What&#39;s Office 2.0?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-s-office-2-0/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s the next generation of Network Computer — the environment where you can run all the business apps you need via a web browser and save all your data online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can do this, then you can work from anywhere — the field, the office, the home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can do this, then your computer support costs go away (or at least get reduced a lot.) If all you need is a keyboard, screen, network connection and web browser, then how fast of a machine do you really need? How often will it fail? Why do you need to back it up? Why do you need an operating system as large as Vista?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/&quot;&gt;Ismael Ghalimi&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to pull this all together — to do every single thing, and store every single file, online. It’s a big challenge. He’s keeping track of &lt;a href=&quot;http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/my-office-20-setup/&quot;&gt;all the apps he needs&lt;/a&gt; and the online solutions. There’s lots of software. Each category has many alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would certainly be a (&lt;em&gt;inhale&lt;/em&gt;) ‘value added communications service on top of the network targetted at small business’ (&lt;em&gt;exhale&lt;/em&gt;) Wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-7345_3-6123652.html&quot;&gt;We’re not alone&lt;/a&gt;. Intel is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/07/intel-suitetwo-product-suite-launches/&quot;&gt;building suites too.&lt;/a&gt; But we don’t have to invent it to add value for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could pull together a suite (ok, a bundle) of these services for small business customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could offer the suite for much less than the cost of MS Office?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could support it as a suite rather than 40 independent products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could integrate it with handsets as well as PC’s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”“Telco 2.0™” defines any business model where connectivity is supported by a sustainable economic model. This means the end of artificial cross-subsidies between services and connectivity. We assume an all-IP world where choice of applications, devices and platforms is entirely driven by user preference. Connectivity charges will increasingly reflect actual costs of delivery (unlike, say, mobile roaming charges); relatively trivial services like standard voice call routing are effectively free; and thus the scope for the latter subsidising the former ceases to exist Customers will only take your replacement offering because they want it, not because they have no choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could use some of their business model frameworks when assessing our Service Development arenas?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Inspiration in Dog Walking</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been having trouble thinking of topics to write about this week. Well, &#39;Personal Blog&#39; stuff anyway. I spent some time pulling together a quick &#39;Business Blog&#39; (_now incorporated as &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/_site/tags/the-company/&quot;&gt;The Company&lt;/a&gt;) to show some colleagues at work. If there&#39;s some interest I might get one started at work. But it&#39;s been tough finding things worth writing about once I finally sit down at the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until I took Buddy for a walk tonight. I wasn&#39;t three houses down the street before I started formulating several ideas in my head. Too bad I couldn&#39;t write and walk at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this calls for a new routine -- dog walking followed by a beeline to the blog site. Maybe I&#39;ll put my laptop on the kitchen counter by the door...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hockey Round Table</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/hockey-round-table/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another fun weekend at the rink. Robyn got her first start in net on Saturday in Lumsden. She played well all game, but really got strong as the game went on. She had quite a bit of fun but I think she&#39;s already thinking about playing forward again. It was a fun change of pace but I think the cachet of being a goalie has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One highlight of the week was a practice in Sedley on Wednesday night. Robyn&#39;s team was practicing but the coach invited Ben to come out so they would have two goalies. As Robyn was getting ready for her big start, that meant both kids were in goal gear at the same time. Quite a treat to see them practicing together. It&#39;s especially neat to since they are two years apart but pretty much the same size. They had fun and I sure had fun watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pee Wee news, the Sharks practiced at 7AM this morning but that was about it. Our savvy manager scheduled picture day for this practice to make sure everyone showed up. Ben&#39;s got tournaments the next two weekends so we&#39;re ramping up for some serious action!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Death of the Phone Company</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/death-of-the-phone-company/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/death-of-the-phone-company/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just re-read a Telco 2.0 post called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telco2.net/blog/2006/11/death_of_the_phone_company.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death of the Phone Company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; I understand more of it now than the first time but I’m still not sure I get it all. It’s a long post — there is likely more than one nugget in there. Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context (where you are / what you are doing) will drive the interface of all new “applications” –&amp;gt; cf. Forrester’s “Content Centric Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk or Voice will be only one feature of these applications. One of several ways to communicate with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web 2.0 ’social network’ apps / services are the key apps of the future. More and more, those are the ‘places’ people will be when they want to communicate or collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos don’t own the context today; the application providers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Telcos are losing the context, what are they going to do? Build their own social networking apps and try to grow market share, or partner with the app providers and make improve the overall customer experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos have 2-5 years to figure this out or risk losing relevance (and revenue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Am I Fiscally Conservative?  Do I Want to Be?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/am-i-fiscally-conservative-do-i-want-to-be/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/am-i-fiscally-conservative-do-i-want-to-be/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://touamoto.wordpress.com/2007/01/07/left-or-right/&quot;&gt;Left or Right? « Touamoto Sakimata-Smith&lt;/a&gt; my buddy Greg talked about being &#39;fiscally conservative&#39; and it got my blood flowing a bit -- brought back an earlier conversation I had with my city councilor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a problem with the term &#39;fiscally conservative&#39; for a while now, because I see it as having mixed meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m &#39;fiscally conservative&#39; with my own money because I don&#39;t do into debt for things (pay cash whenever I can, pay down the mortgage ASAP, do without if I don&#39;t have the money.) I also don&#39;t own any penny stocks or precious metal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But insofar as public policy, I believe that we&#39;re better off as a society if there is a strong &#39;Common Good&#39;. I believe that there is value in public services far beyond the cost of them. Because of that I&#39;ve been a strong advocate for public libraries, public education and city services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t subscribe to the opinion that all taxes are evil by definition and that we should cut every public service possible in order to keep taxes down. I want to make sure my governments are managing our shared pool of money well, but I WANT to pay taxes and I WANT my taxes to go toward strong public services. So I&#39;m much more concerned about getting the most common &#39;bang&#39; for my tax buck than paying fewer tax bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&#39;t have a problem paying more taxes than someone who lives in a smaller house or makes less money. If I have &#39;more&#39;, I don&#39;t have trouble paying more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I still call myself fiscally conservative? Has the term been co-opted to imply &#39;I Hate Taxes&#39; or am I using the term incorrectly?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>About the Company</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/about-the-company/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/about-the-company/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In January 2007, this was what the site was about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having lunch with a work colleague (he has since retired) and he mentioned that he was frustrated that he couldn’t get an internal blog started. I thought, “that’s odd”, since there are a lot of good, free blog services available. So I started this blog to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;post a bit, to show how relevant, interesting ideas can be aggregated in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invite my work colleagues to come to the blog to read it, comment and contribute (maybe within this blog, maybe with their own blog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promote RSS services like Google Reader to show people how they can bring my posts (and other, even better posts) to one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this gets some traction, and our security group/corporate communications folks get scared, I’ll show them how we can bring the whole thing in-house with the same software (available at wordpress.org Voila! An internal blog service, with pre-built community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In August 2008, this is what the site was about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read things. I learn things. I talk to people. Every three months my notebook is full and I get a new one. But my ideas aren&#39;t getting any momentum. Since I&#39;m responsible for parts of the marketing strategy, that&#39;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formal, approved way to publish strategies is to write executive items and create powerpoint charts. No problem there. But that&#39;s the worst way to collaborate and spread ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m going to write here, share what I learn and over time some themes will emerge. Your comments will help that happen. When the themes get solid, I&#39;ll rewrite them into Executive Items and powerpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geez Louise! This is on the Internet!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it is. Take some deep, cleansing breaths. Ahhh...feeling better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s on the internet because I can set it up easily and it will integrate with feed readers like Google Reader. That way you can get public ideas in the same place as my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a private blog -- invitation only. I think these kinds of things should be public, so customers and partners can see what we&#39;re thinking about and add their comment, but that&#39;s a corporate hill I&#39;m not willing to climb right now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politicalcompass.org/&quot;&gt;neat survey&lt;/a&gt; over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/12/28#showingTendencies&quot;&gt;Doc Searls weblog&lt;/a&gt; last week. It attempts to plot one on a 2x2 matrix based on the more traditional &#39;left - right&#39; political continuum but also on a social axis.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Motivated to Innovate</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/motivated-to-innovate/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/motivated-to-innovate/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; stuff these days. LOTS -- books, e-books, blog posts and anything else I can find. He&#39;s not only a breath of fresh air but he&#39;s helped me look at the work I&#39;ve been doing in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How&#39;s that? Well, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/Free-Prize-Inside-Seth-Godin/dp/1591840414/sr=8-1/qid=1167671959/ref=sr_1_1/702-2769389-8172861?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&quot;&gt;Free Prize Inside&lt;/a&gt; he talks about how white collar workers have been living a lie for a while now. Our ability to innovate (i.e. our ideas and creativity) are the only reason we&#39;re worth our salaries, especially considering all the people who would be willing to do our jobs for the same or less money. So do we innovate like crazy? Generally, no. Instead we want processes, rules, and detailed instructions about how to do our jobs -- those things which make us closer to an assembly line worker (skilled, yes, but also easily replaceable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never used to be one to use &amp;quot;the rules&amp;quot; as a crutch to protect the status quo, but lately I&#39;ve slipped into the easy trap of &amp;quot;going with the flow.&amp;quot; It rings hollow inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I&#39;m not one for New Years resolutions, but this year I have one. I&#39;m going to re-focus on creativity and innovation -- in gaining new customers and building better business partnerships. I&#39;m going champion my own ideas and those of my colleagues. I&#39;m not going to stop the first time I get told &#39;no&#39; or get told it&#39;s &#39;outside the policy.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m going to do it only because it&#39;s fun and personally fulfilling. I know up front that, outside of leaving the company, I won&#39;t get paid more, get a promotion or even get a better chair. What I will get is another fun, fulfilling project. Or fired. At this point, either result is better than status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Excerpts from the 2006 Christmas Letter</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/excerpts-from-the-2006-christmas-letter/"/>
		<updated>2006-12-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/excerpts-from-the-2006-christmas-letter/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After three years of disappointments, I finally wrote another Christmas letter. I think it topped out at 5 pages once Cindy increased the font to something viewable by the Bifocal Generation. That means it&#39;s a little too long to simply copy in one post. Besides, by the time anyone I know finds this blog it&#39;ll be spring and there will be many new posts. So here&#39;s some highlights -- at least descriptions of things that are worth preserving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding Ben:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ben does very well in school he&#39;s hit the point where he&#39;d much rather be at home doing his own thing. Ben&#39;s a quiet kid so the mayhem of the classroom wears him out. Ben&#39;s read pretty much every popular kids book that&#39;s been written, to the point where Cindy&#39;s pre-reading &amp;quot;young adult&amp;quot; books to make sure they are appropriate. Although that&#39;s now gone by the wayside, since she wasn&#39;t keeping up to his pace -- Cindy still searches out books for Ben, but now he just lets her know which one she should read. The net result is I&#39;ve now lost them both to the seductive power of Literature. Robyn and I are coping but our eating habits may not be the best when those two are binging on books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben is &amp;quot;Snow Boy&amp;quot; and is a perfect complement to Summer Girl. In summer Ben&#39;s favorite place is sitting on the patio with a stack of books, but after the first snowfall he&#39;s outside for hours on end building snow forts, cutting trails or lying in a snowbank staring at the sky. It took the coming of winter for Ben to find a way to play with Buddy (our 11 month old golden retriever pup) so that Ben had fun and Buddy got tired. It helps Cindy and I too since once it gets cold we just want to hibernate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben&#39;s favorite pastime is still hockey. It&#39;s the only thing that will get him out of bed at 7AM without complaint. Ben plays goalie for the Pee Wee Minor Sharks. It&#39;s his fifth year in minor hockey and his third between the pipes full time. This has been a challenging season for the Sharks -- 1 win so far this season and all the play is in the Sharks end of the ice. So Ben&#39;s been busy. 60-80 shots per game is common and Ben&#39;s been holding his own. It&#39;s an odd situation when the Shark&#39;s can lose 10-0 and Ben gets player of the game, but that&#39;s the reality this year. What&#39;s been great to see is that his self confidence and self esteem is remaining intact and is even growing as the season progresses. He loves the work and is getting stronger all the time. Now if he were only taller than the net...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding Robyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn still amazes me with how much she is aware of what&#39;s going on in the world around her. She&#39;s growing into quite an outspoken leader, whether it&#39;s at school, home or with her friends. Last fall our elementary school was threatened with closure and Robyn had letters written to the school administration and trustees within 48 hours. Her main concern was who would take care of some of her friends who needed help in their classes or on the playground. We&#39;re extremely proud (and at times inspired) by her caring nature -- even though it tires us out. Mom and Dad are expected to be on the front lines of The Cause, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn&#39;s newest passion is hockey. She&#39;s playing in her second year of minor hockey, this year with the Atom House Stingers. She&#39;s the only girl on her team and is a hit with her teammates and coaches. She got her first goal of the season early but lately has been playing solid defense -- she&#39;s one of the bigger kids on the team and doesn&#39;t lose many battles for the puck. She was quite upset last season when an opposing player swore at her in frustration; she felt better when we told her that meant she was doing her job very well! When she&#39;s not playing hockey, Robyn can be found reading, listening to audiobooks on the iPod (the six Harry Potter books seem to be on a continuous loop), riding her bike or skateboard, or drawing pictures for her family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call Robyn &amp;quot;Summer Girl&amp;quot; because outside of hockey she seems a little lost in the wintertime, but in the warmer months she&#39;s outside all day, every day. She&#39;s got the travel bug really bad after our trips to BC in 2004 and especially our big trip to Nova Scotia and PEI in 2005. During the Maritime adventure Robyn spent approximately 1,400 hours on the beach -- that&#39;s a lot of smiling! It didn&#39;t matter that the water was cold enough to numb all your limbs. She&#39;s helping us scrimp and save for a trip to Italy (maybe in 2008?) as she&#39;s dying to see Venice in person (although we won&#39;t let her swim in the canals!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding Cindy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy is without a doubt the most active person in the family. One of our friends jokes that Cindy &#39;runs southwest Regina&#39; and there are times when it feels like that&#39;s the case. She&#39;s been president of the Athabasca PTA for a couple terms over the past four years and is heavily involved in the fight for smaller schools, smaller class sizes and greater flexibility from the school administration. Through the community association, over the past three years she&#39;s led a large park improvement project, adding new pre-school play equipment to a neighbourhood park. Cindy organizes an annual &amp;quot;Reading Week&amp;quot; at Athabasca, with author visits, storytellers, cartoon drawing workshops puppet shows, etc. - a highlight for kids, and Cin&#39;s favorite project of the year. She&#39;s also been a very strong supporter of our public libraries, pushing me to take action during the fight to save three branch libraries in 2003-2004 and then holding down the house every night while I was at a meeting or writing press releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy&#39;s latest project is our golden retriever, Buddy. We got him in April and he&#39;s now a very large 11 month old &#39;pup&#39;. Buddy is a very calm, well mannered dog due in no small part to the amount of time Cindy&#39;s put into working with him. He&#39;s an active dog and needs at least two 45 minute walks every day so we&#39;ve been outside quite a bit, but it&#39;s been worth it. We don&#39;t have any of the &#39;horror stories&#39; you hear about dogs chewing things up, barking like crazy or biting people, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, yours truly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m &#39;in between&#39; projects lately as I&#39;m trying to get our bakery business off the ground. I&#39;m now past-president of the Lakeview Community Association after spending seven years as treasurer and then chairman. I&#39;m no longer involved in Friends of Regina Public Library after spending a year leading the communications team in the fight to prevent closures and another year working with the library board on public consultations (although I&#39;m supposed to have the first draft of my chapter of a book on the fight done by January.) I&#39;m not on our church board as we&#39;ve decided to take a step back and re-evaluate what we&#39;re looking for in a faith community. I stayed on the sidelines during the latest civic election and I&#39;m trying to stay behind the scenes on the next round of public school consultations (although it&#39;s turning into such a complete and utter sham that I might get sucked into the fray.) So this winter I&#39;m happy to say that I&#39;m &#39;only&#39; Robyn&#39;s hockey team co-manager (with Cindy) and leave it at that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past year or two has also been spent coming to terms with the reality that my parent&#39;s health is declining. My mom has been battling cancer for over 15 years now and the past two years have been especially difficult. She went through 18 months of chemotherapy in 2004-2005 and is now on regular chemo pills to control the spread of cancer. It&#39;s had a bad effect on her blood so she needs regular IV supplements. It&#39;s been hard for me to understand that the new normal state for mom is to be tired all the time and to spend all her time either at home or the hospital. My dad is still able to take care of things so that they can stay living at the farm, but he had a scare this summer when doctors found cancer in his right lung. He had surgery to remove part of his lung in August and it looks like the surgery was successful -- no more cancer and no treatments required. But the lack of lung capacity shows as dad is more out of breath than usual and he&#39;s still quite sore from the major surgery. Through all of this I&#39;ve been dependent on and extremely thankful for my sister Wanda, who has helped translate all the doctor-speak and ensure that mom and dad are getting the best possible home care. I don&#39;t know how families can deal with the health care system without having some background in the field -- I know I&#39;d be completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s lots more, and I can send it out if you like :-)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The dough hook for my 20QT Hobart Mixer arrived this week so I&#39;ve got the itch to do some large scale baking. I spent most of Friday giving the mixer a good clean. When I bought it it looked pretty clean already but once I got started I realized it was actually quite grimy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m in a bit of trouble because the bowl lift is all gummed up. I think the previous owners were using the mixer for icing because the whole bowl lift mechanism is plugged up with syrup. I finally decided to take the bowl lift apart but the 6 screws that hold it all together are seized up too. I tried heat, cold, water and penetrating lube but I can&#39;t get them to budge at all. Hopefully Canadian Tire has some miracle product that will release the screws.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hockey Morning in Canada</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/hockey-morning-in-canada/"/>
		<updated>2006-12-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/hockey-morning-in-canada/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Up at 6:15AM for Robyn&#39;s 7:30 practice in White City. There weren&#39;t many kids out and even fewer parents. I usually like the early morning stuff because I have the whole day in front of me after hockey. Although right now I&#39;m pretty darn tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn got to practice in goal and did really well for her first time in pads this year. She hasn&#39;t mentioned goal much this year but now that she&#39;s had a practice she&#39;s eager to play in a game. My thoughts? Officially they don&#39;t matter and it&#39;s good for her to try all the positions, but I sure wouldn&#39;t mind having one child play out, purely from the spectators point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all went out for breakfast after the practice. Went to McDonald&#39;s which wasn&#39;t my or Robyn&#39;s first choice but it actually wasn&#39;t that bad. Perhaps the McDioxins are merging with my cell structure, or maybe because they have Hockey Cards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good chance to talk with more of the parents. More and more of the kids are involved in Basketball these days; half the team had games or practices at 10. The fees seem reasonable (100-150 per year) but wow that&#39;s a big time commitment if you&#39;re also playing hockey. I can&#39;t see how our kids would survive playing two sports at the same time when each sport is twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>But I Want To Follow Directions!!</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/but-i-want-to-follow-directions/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reviewing recent posts at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/brick-oven/&quot;&gt;brick oven list&lt;/a&gt; and there was a post from a fellow just starting his oven building journey. He&#39;s going to be building a 5&#39;x7&#39; oven based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ovencrafters.net&quot;&gt;Alan Scott&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; plans and was frustrated that the number and type of blocks the plans called for is a little off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was &#39;join the club&#39; as I found many inconsistencies with my oven plans too. In the end my oven build required the knowledge within the plans, Alan himself, the brick oven list, my own experience, knowledge from product suppliers (minimal) and the opinions of a half dozen friends and family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean the plans are no good? I don&#39;t think so. Maybe they are just mis-named. People have an expectation that &#39;plans&#39;, especially plans which cost up to 10% of the price of materials, should be very clear step by step instructions. Clear pictures, no inconsistencies and on Right Way to put the thing together. Alan Scott&#39;s oven plans are not that type of &#39;plan.&#39; I see them as more the compiled wisdom and best practices of a man who has built over 100 of these ovens and has been around long enough to see them in action for many years. Ideas change over time and Alan&#39;s views on oven construction have changed over time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with inconsistencies in the plans were a pain in the butt, no doubt. But in the end it was an advantage too. I now know the purpose of every component of the oven because I had to make a conscious decision of how to build each piece. Now could the plans due with a new revision? You bet. But I suspect Alan is more interested in building ovens and learning from the build experience than going through the work of revising the plans. When I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Bread-Builders-Hearth-Loaves-Masonry/dp/1890132055&quot;&gt;his book on oven building&lt;/a&gt; I got the sense that Dan Wing was the catalyst for getting all Alan&#39;s thoughts into a format where a book could actually be created. Perhaps &amp;quot;Brick Oven Plans 2.0&amp;quot; is an opportunity for enterprising copy editor with a passion for bread...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While the oven may be snowbound and Van may be iced up, this week&#39;s cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls has brought one of my favourite people back to life. Ben, aka Snow Boy, has once again magically transformed from moody bookworm to icy adventurer. Within 24 hours, there was a 4 foot igloo in the front yard. By Day Two, the igloo had three exits. Work on the side rooms is progressing nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow Boy&#39;s autumn nemesis, Buddy Dog, is now his faithful companion, spending hour after finger numbing hour in the back yard fetching hunks of snow and ice. Boy and Dog seem to embrace the frozen white stuff as their native habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in 1993 we decided that our new minivan was going to last us a long time. We didn&#39;t want to be strapped with perpetual payments (no matter how &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;monthly&amp;quot; and the decision was consistent with our frugal values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, we didn&#39;t know what a &#39;long time&#39; looked like. Some vague time past 10 years for sure, but we were foggy about the details. We&#39;re now a couple months away from Van&#39;s 14th birthday and it might be getting close to end of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van hasn&#39;t been blowing heat (in the winter anyway) for a few years now and a couple years ago started the annoying habit of throwing off the serpentine belt whenever it goes through more than four inches of snow. This week the temperatures dropped below -30C and it snowed a lot. Instant icy insides and the belts come off twice already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van&#39;s now at the repair shop. We&#39;ll learn tomorrow if it will be pulled off life support.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-dog-whisperer/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was extra-tired at Robyn&#39;s practice because Cindy and I were up late watching old episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dogpsychologycenter.com/dogwhisperer/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Dog Whisperer&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; They are hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dogpsychologycenter.com/cesar/&quot;&gt;Cesar Millan&lt;/a&gt; whose shtick Dog Psychology. He&#39;s absolutely hilarious! My favorite line to dog owners: &amp;quot;They&#39;re not less than human; they&#39;re just not human&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main theme of the show is that dogs are most comfortable when they are in a pack and are around the dominant pack leader. So be that leader! The mindset you want the dog to be in is &amp;quot;calm-submissive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one tip that I think will work wonders with buddy is that, in dogs, there is a big difference between &#39;excited&#39; and &#39;happy&#39;. To Cesar, &#39;excited&#39; is just as bad as &#39;agitated&#39;. The dog is &#39;happy&#39; when he is &#39;calm-submissive&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that for Cesar&#39;s advice to work owners need to get over any negative connotations about the word &#39;submissive&#39;. Submissive is perceived by most to be a strongly negative human term but it&#39;s a strongly positive dog behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s snowing for about the fifth day in a row now and as I look out the dining room window at the brick oven I can help but wonder what effect all that snow has on the brickwork. I didn&#39;t get a chimney cap installed (or designed) in time so there&#39;s about 4 inches of snow on top of the chimney and inside too. My wood pile is buried too so the wood certainly isn&#39;t seasoning the way I&#39;d like. I think the best approach is to split it as small as I can manage and store it under the oven till spring. At least it&#39;ll stay dry that way.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s my first post on my Wordpress blog. I&#39;ve been &amp;quot;firmly persuaded&amp;quot; to write more and I wanted to do that in a way that I could share it, add photos, video, etc. and Wordpress looks like a good place to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not completely sure what to write about, or at least how to organize it. Lots of interests, you might say. But one of the things I&#39;m tired of is waiting to get everything figured out before I take a step and that bad habit stops right here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, it stops with the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of markdown packages are installed to help you write your posts. You can configure them in &lt;code&gt;config/plugins/markdown.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of my personal preference, there are some presets. For example the automatic conversion of web pages to links (lenesaile.com) and the automatic addition of &lt;code&gt;target: &#39;_blank&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rel: &#39;noreferrer noopener&#39;&lt;/code&gt; for external links (all links with the pattern&lt;code&gt;/^https?:/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small pitfall! Take care to not prefix your internal links with your domain, or else they will be treated ad external as well. To link internally use this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;An internal link to the [about page](/about/)

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;URLs usually change over time, as you use another CMS or optimizye your file structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 301 is used when a page has permanently changed location.
Informing about this change is indispensable if you want to keep your incoming links working, be it from organic Google search or other pages that have linked to your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleksandr Hovhannisyan came up with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-netlify-redirects/&quot;&gt;elegant solution for Eleventy and Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. To directly cover several possible previous routes it is created as an array. You can find the loop in &lt;code&gt;_redirects.njk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you share your blog posts, a thumbnail image may appear - the image we define in our meta data as an Open Graph Image (&lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starter now generates these images for your blog posts automatically.
The fallback and default image for all other pages is the image set as &lt;code&gt;opengraph_default&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;meta.js&lt;/code&gt; global data file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;meta-info.njk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;og:image&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{{ meta.url }}&lt;br&gt;  {% if (layout == &#39;post&#39;) %}/assets/images/social-preview/{{ title | slugify }}-preview.jpeg&lt;br&gt;  {% else %}{{ meta.meta_data.opengraph_default }}&lt;br&gt;  {% endif %}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the look and behaviour of those images and replace the SVG background edit &lt;code&gt;src/social-preview.njk&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bnijenhuis.nl/notes/automatically-generate-open-graph-images-in-eleventy/&quot;&gt;Bernard Nijenhuis article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
