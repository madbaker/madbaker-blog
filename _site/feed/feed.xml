Both on their farm on Lopez Island.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to an island in the Pacific Northwest is not easy.  Moving intentionally, with a view of contributing to the community is even more difficult.  But Sage Dilts and Nathan Hodges have done just that with their farm and bakery on Lopez Island, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an awesome talk, ranging from when Sage and Nathan met in grad school in the Bay Area, where Sage developed her baking chops, how they found their way to Lopez Island and how the locals embraced their quest to make the best bread from the localist grains.  And how Barn Owl Bakery is feeding their village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Scott and other mentors make recurring appearances in the journey, as a mentor and guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listened to our conversation again, I was struck by how important it was to Sage and Nathan to give something to their new community, rather than simply move in and enjoying the natural beauty.  They&#39;re both committed to making the earth a better place and they&#39;re doing it through service.  I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&#39;t take my word for it!  Listen for yourself below.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read an article today where scientists claim that your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/05/short-term-memory-illusions-study.&quot;&gt;memories can start changing in three seconds&lt;/a&gt;  No sh*t, Sherlock.  I think it&#39;s quicker than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bent out of shape last week over some chocolate croissants.  No more than 15 chocolate croissants.  I wanted to help out and shape them and was encouraged not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was heard, according to me, was that I don&#39;t shape them well and it would be easier for someone else to do it than show me what my technique lacked.  And that I was a simple, fat hairy oaf who smelled bad, talked odd and had literal sausages for fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was said, according to the speaker, was that I had already done more than expected, was looking tired and hey, why not head on home and we&#39;ll go again tomorrow.  Can I make you lunch before you go?  And by the way, have you lost weight?  You&#39;re looking pretty good these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was ACTUALLY said?  Who knows?  The entire conversation could be recorded, we could both listen to it and still hear the two conversations above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given that nothing is real, what are we to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give more grace.  Lots more grace.  To me.  To you.  To us and them and everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good, bad or neutral, we heard it wrong.  And &lt;em&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; a scientific fact.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Serendipity, emails and rabbit holes have taken me far, far down Memory Lane today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got an email from my friend Mar, who I haven&#39;t talked to in a few years.  She was thinking about Hot Cross Buns and how, that first Easter when we opened Orange Boot Bakery, we turned her partner Bruce away empty handed at least three times on the Saturday before Easter.  We just didn&#39;t know how to hold orders yet.  After we closed we took the last dozen buns (which I think were reserved for Cindy&#39;s mom), looked up their address and brought them to the house.  It&#39;s been 12 years and they haven&#39;t forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we got to chatting and Mar reminded me of the name Beth Traynor, who ran an awesome little catering business out of a small shop on Robinson and 13th Avenue.  Beth made the best carrot cake (among other delicious food).   She even made the carrot cake for our wedding over 30 years ago and I was sad to forget her name, and glad to now remember it again.  Beth&#39;s long since retired and she is still missed in Regina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other news, my search of personal website inspiration (that I might &#39;steal&#39; for this site) took me to a brand new  (to me) website by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carolynzhang.com/&quot;&gt;Carolyn Zhang&lt;/a&gt;.  She wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carolynzhang.com/2020/introduction&quot;&gt;a masterful pair of essays&lt;/a&gt; on her experience designing campaign software on the fly for the 2020 US election and how the experience affected her personally. Wow.  Deep reflection on how doing work that matters to you often conflicts with internal narratives that have built up over a lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - my personal website &#39;research&#39; also took me to a blog that I read 20 years ago and haven&#39;t been to in over 15.  It&#39;s still going strong. What a thrill thrill to dig through the archives and remember what I was reading before my baking life.  Then, sadly, I read the new stuff.  Let&#39;s just say that he didn&#39;t seem to be such a crank in 2004.  I shall not be sharing a link.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Five Bits of Gratitude</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/five-bits-of-gratitude/"/>
		<updated>2023-04-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/five-bits-of-gratitude/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another habit that needs reinforcing.  It&#39;s too easy to slide into dark talk when in actual fact, there is much good in the world, and much good inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five of those good things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The massive dark cloud which seems to frame The Empress Hotel most evenings dissipated in time for the most brilliant spring sunset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry trees and magnolias are in bloom all over Victoria, which make my walks to and from work magical.  I&#39;m so lucky to live in this beautiful city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cindy made pancakes!  Which is excellent full stop.  But triply so because tomorrow is a &#39;wheat day&#39; for my elimination / re-integration diet, so I shall be having leftover pancakes for breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22571656&quot;&gt;The Happiness Equation&lt;/a&gt; which Cin found in a Free Little Library box and I had left in the back bedroom.  Upon re-opening, the first thing I read reminded me that &lt;em&gt;I love working on teams&lt;/em&gt; and that teamwork is very important to me.  Which is lacking at UP.  We get along, but we&#39;re not a team.  Or I&#39;m not feeling it.  Glad I remembered something that&#39;s important to me but currently lacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question on B4B has reminded me how difficult but amazing Easter baking was at Orange Boot.  And it follows on that...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bakers4Bakers is a good place.  I&#39;m grateful for the people who share and learn and grow there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wascana.sk.ca/&quot;&gt;Wascana Park&lt;/a&gt; in Regina, Saskatchewan is often called the Jewel of the Queen City and that&#39;s true. It&#39;s a massive, lovely greenspace right in the middle of Regina, wrapping around Wascana Lake and anchored by the impressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Legislative_Building&quot;&gt;Saskatchewan Legislative Building&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s all man made, and we love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more often than not, the park is pretty much empty.  Cindy and I walk around the lake most days and we usually don&#39;t meet more than a couple of dozen people on our hour long walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major exception to this rule is Canada Day (July 1), when the park is full of people.  I walked down to the park in the late afternoon to check things out and see what was shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew things were hopping before I ever got to the park.  There were cars parked up and down Regina Avenue all the way back to Elphinstone Street and along the side streets too, as people came from all points of the city to have fun in the grass.  Lots of red and white outfits, miniature flags and interesting coolers full of refreshments too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/uGs9-xHIll-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/uGs9-xHIll-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; alt=&quot;Cool Cooler&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that&#39;s a cool cooler!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was lots going on.  I avoided the Legislature at the start and turn left instead, making a clockwise loop around the lake.  The area around &amp;quot;the Leg&amp;quot; (with a soft &#39;g&#39; please) was pretty loud.  I could hear a cover band playing the Canadian classic &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OX_8YvFxA&quot;&gt;Barracuda&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; so I gave it a miss for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ioAAS1mEkE-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ioAAS1mEkE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; alt=&quot;Dickie Dee&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no chance of going hungry today.  Even on the &#39;quiet side&#39; of the lake the Dickie Dee guys are there to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I walked around to Willow Island and watched some kids feeding the geese.  The goslings are already getting pretty big and  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get even bigger after getting fed so much bread today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8SrQogF2v6-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8SrQogF2v6-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Feeding Geese&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south side of Wascana Park has lots of barbeques and picnic tables and they were all in use today.  Heavily in use.  The barbeques are a perfect place for a family picnic and it seemed like each bbq had a dozen or more people using it.  There were ball games and badminton games going on all over the place.   Lots of fun. I was tempted to pose as a long lost cousin so I could get a hot dog and some watermelon, but I chickened out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SRe9aUmTx4-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/SRe9aUmTx4-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; alt=&quot;Canada Day Picnic&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Wascana Park is that it&#39;s so big, many thousands of people can come out and there&#39;s still lots of space.  For most of the loop around the lake is still green and lovely, even if the path is a little more crowded than usual on Canada Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/W1V1oEYhJy-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/W1V1oEYhJy-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;People Walking&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are a lot busier in front of the Legislative Building, however. There are lots of food trucks and knick knack booths and activities for the kids. It&#39;s a lot noisier than the rest of the park but there&#39;s a vibrant energy to the area too.  Lots of activities for the kids and grownups too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I left for home, I found where all the music was coming from.  This year, they had a real live stage set up with a fenced off beer garden.  Being Canada Day, I&#39;m sure the bands were playing Patriotic Songs of the Day, but I couldn&#39;t quite make out the words.  Ah well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be heading back to the park later tonight for the fireworks.  Canada Day fireworks are Regina&#39;s biggest, best (and some years, the only) fireworks of the year in the park.  They&#39;re not to be missed.  2017 is Canada&#39;s 150th birthday; I can&#39;t wait to see those!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent two interesting days exploring hot, sunny downtown Anaheim while Robyn was enjoying the air conditioned VidCon conference at the Anaehim Convention Centre. I&#39;d walk with her for the first two blocks, then she&#39;d head off, I&#39;d stop for my morning cappuccino and then head north to the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jrsxpjg-3C-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/jrsxpjg-3C-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nice California ranch house in central Anaheim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Anaheim Resort District, aka Disneyland, a city of hotels, fifteen Denny&#39;s and a dozen IHOP&#39;s isn&#39;t actually the city of Anaheim. There&#39;s a real town centre that pre-dates Walt&#39;s Big Dream by 60 years or so, but it&#39;s separated from the Resort District by the massive I-5 Freeway. Harbour Drive crosses the I-5, and so did I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/6fPFl0KaH9-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/6fPFl0KaH9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long hike in the hot sun. It took me 3/4 of Blonde on Blonde to make it (all but Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands) and honestly, it&#39;s just hot walking. I got to see the back side of Disney though, which is interesting in its own way. If I was ever making a James Bond film, I&#39;d film it there; all the unmarked white vans, security checkpoints, severe tire damage gates and electrical generators would make a great villains lair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VH4x3Q120u-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VH4x3Q120u-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once across the I-5, I thought I was coming up to a light security prison, or a half way house maybe. I saw a cluster of low, long army-green barracks with a tall wrought iron fence all around it. I was shocked to find it was a school! Each building was two or three classrooms with private entrances and a asphalt playground in the middle. Whoo boy would it be hot on that playground! I know security is a big thing in schools these days but man, they are taking it a little far at Orange Grove School if you ask me. Maybe it&#39;s colourful on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ztuYJgluEn-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ztuYJgluEn-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy had done some recon for me and told me about a downtown farmer&#39;s market on Thursday. So that was my first port of call. It was also my fourth port of call, since there was nothing going on at 10AM when I first arrived. I guess it&#39;s geared toward the office workers and doesn&#39;t really get going until noon. But it was worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BAzV6VQyyk-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BAzV6VQyyk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market was laid out like a Y. The long bottom bit was the farmers; tables piled with melons and peaches and onions and strawberries. Lots of the fruit was spilled out cornucopia style, rather than the neatly stacked fruit at European markets, but it was all fresh and yummy and was all grown by the people selling it (which is rarely the case in Europe too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1oA2_s5C1Y-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left arm of the Y was the artisans; jewelry, knick knacks and designer kibble for your pooch. and the right arm was the food trucks. Yum! Fried chicken, barbecue, falafel, wood fired pizza and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it was so hot that I couldn&#39;t really work up an appetite, or a big sausage on a bun would&#39;ve been my lunch. Instead, I bought a baguette from the bread booth and a basket of strawberries and ate them in the shade. It was the right call; I still had to walk back over the I-5 to get back to the motel.&lt;/p&gt;

Jail sucks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I hiked back downtown. After stopping at the public library to write a post and flip through a few books, I walked one block further than the farmer&#39;s market site to the Anaheim Packing House. This huge building was once the Sunkist citrus packing house, where oranges and lemons would get packed in crates and put on trains. Now it&#39;s a gourmet food centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 20+ food stalls inside, selling everything from sushi to ice cream. There&#39;s even a booth dedicated to variations of grilled cheese sandwiches. I walked around both floors twice before buying a barbecue chicken sandwich and a local beer, and then an ice cream cone for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not easy to get to downtown Anaheim without a car. But if you need a break from Disney and can&#39;t handle yet another trip to Denny&#39;s or IHOP, it&#39;s well worth checking out. It doesn&#39;t take me long to need a break from Fantasyland, so I&#39;m glad I went exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In Search of Sambo&#39;s</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been to Anaheim before, but it&#39;s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from weekend fishing and camping trips, I only took two family vacations with my parents. The first, when I was 10, was a three week trip to Windsor and Detroit (via Bemidji Minnesota and Niagara Falls) for my cousin Mary Catherine&#39;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was to Anaheim and Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came in March, when I was in Grade 7. I remember just how green everything was; from the moment we left the airport I couldn&#39;t believe all the green grass everywhere. Even the school fields were lush and green! We had prairie scrub at Ruth M. Buck school. Mixed with gravel. If you fell on the playground you were guaranteed a scraped knee and quite possibly some embedded stones. And anyway, it was St. Patrick&#39;s Day; my playground at home would be covered in snow for at least a month yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ItjwtzwHTE-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ItjwtzwHTE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ahh, vacations... This way we have room for Granny!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There were five of us on the trip. My Aunty Donna, mom&#39;s youngest sister, was still single and flew down with us. She was the most important person in my 12 year old world; it hadn&#39;t been that long since she&#39;d been living in our basement on Bruce Street and then in her own apartment in Regina. We&#39;d watch the Carol Burnett Show together on TV every Thursday night and laugh like crazy. And she&#39;d let me read her old Mad Magazines and listen to her Donovan and Beatles records. She was so cool. But now she lived in Calgary, which would become the exotic escape for my sister Wanda and me for years to come. So we were thrilled she was coming on this big vacation with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna had a job working in PR at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, and she brought along a small bag of promotional material about Calgary. Since it was 1978, 10 years before the Winter Olympics would put Calgary on the world map, promotion was a big deal. But also, since it was 1978, it was still funny to roll up a fact sheet about Calgary, written in a tiny font on a small piece of paper, and put it in a clear plastic capsule. The fact sheet was titled &amp;quot;DOPE About Calgary&amp;quot; but all that showed on the capsule was the &amp;quot;DOPE&amp;quot; part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right, my hip, cool Aunt brought a baggie of white plastic capsules labelled DOPE on our family trip to California. You know what happened: she got picked for a random search at the airport, was asked about the baggie, and said &amp;quot;That&#39;s my dope!&amp;quot; Our time at the airport was a little longer than we planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did everything you&#39;d expect on a 70&#39;s romp through Southern California. We went to Disneyland, Knott&#39;s Berry Farm and Universal Studios. We took the bus tour to San Diego and Sea World, stopping at the mission at San Capistrano to see the swallows. We took a tour of Hollywood, saw the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre. It was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, Disneyland was a single park, ringed with tiny motor hotels and there was one big fancy hotel called the Disneyland Hotel. We stayed in a little motor inn, right across the street from the main Disneyland parking lot. The motel we stayed in wasn&#39;t all that different from the Alamo Inn that Robyn and I are staying in now, in fact. Although the this area has changed a lot in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/S_KSWCwnOp-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/S_KSWCwnOp-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our motel. Good beds, great air conditioner, horrid WIFI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now there are two Disney parks side by side; the original Disneyland and a park called Disney California Adventure. Between the two parks are at least four huge Disney hotels and a shopping street called Downtown Disney, where you can buy mouse ears and a shirt even if you can&#39;t afford a ticket inside (a whopping $160USD per person per day now!) And while there&#39;s still several classic motor inns around the park, there are also Hiltons and Marriots and Hamptons and all the other chains too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think California Adventure is where the old parking lot used to be. The parking lot for visitors is several blocks away now; there is a &amp;quot;Toy Story&amp;quot; bus line that constantly shuttles people to and from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they do a lot of shuttling! Disneyland is still a massive draw from what I can see. Every morning, the hotels around us empty my 8:30AM. Half the folks head east to the convention centre, wearing their red, purple or blue VidCon badges. But far more people head north one block to Disneyland, in groups of four or six or eight, typically pushing a stroller, often with grandma in tow, and always, always wearing mouse ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fashion is amazing, including the mouse ears. Disney sure has diversified since the 70&#39;s. No more black Mickey Mouse ears; now, everyone is bedazzled! Sequins, fur, sparkly bows, and even leopard prints are the rage. And every type of Disney t-shirt imaginable is being worn too. They even combine logos now. I saw Mickey as a New York Yankee, Mickey as a LA Dodger, a Laker and an Anaheim Duck. Oddly, not as a Saskatchewan Roughrider, but I&#39;m still looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the dads and grandpas is my favourite pastime. Dad&#39;s tend toward being sun-conscious or sports-conscious. That is, they either have the largest sun hat of the group (sensible and much needed if a little dorky) or are draped head to toe in the colours of their team. I saw all blue Dallas Cowboy fans, including hat, shirt, pants and socks and Cardinals fans who even had red shoes. It&#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my favourite beyond all others is the matching family vacation outfits. I saw a family of six wearing bright orange t-shirts with Snoopy silk screened on the front and &amp;quot;Marshall Family Vacation 2016&amp;quot; underneath. Brilliant! Others wore all pink or all yellow or all green. It reminded me of the stag and stagette crews all around Amsterdam, but these folks were off to Disneyland and good for them. Robyn&#39;s quite disappointed that we didn&#39;t get matching outfits when we did our trips to the Maritimes and Vancouver Island and maybe she has a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ybFRImJ9LX-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ybFRImJ9LX-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go Team Pink!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The other vivid memory of my first trip to Anaheim was the food. My dad is a very fussy eater and that intensified on vacation. On our first vacation to Ontario he insisted on only stopping at Husky House truck stops and ordered the same meal every time. This carried on to California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember walking twice a day, in the morning and evening, south from our motel, alongside the massive Disneyland parking lot, to the southern corner of the park. There, on the corner, was a small family restaurant with the unfortunate name of Sambo&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked to Sambo&#39;s every day for breakfast and every day for supper and Dad ordered the same thing every single time. Bacon, eggs over easy, white toast and coffee for breakfast and hamburger steak, soup and coffee for supper. When our waitress asked Dad if he wanted &#39;the usual&#39; on Day 3 he beamed. There was no way we were going anywhere else now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a few circuits around the Disney Resorts looking for Sambo&#39;s yesterday but I couldn&#39;t find it. I wanted to take Robyn and order a hamburger steak for old times sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure the name changed long ago but the building might still be there. My best guess is a place called Coco&#39;s which is right beside our motel. It&#39;s the right size and on the southwest corner of the current park, just like I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RYY_6LRRYu-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RYY_6LRRYu-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sambo&#39;s? Is that you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m wrong, then the building and a ton of other places have been torn down to make a new employee parking lot. It all depends on whether California Adventure extends further south than the 1978 version of the Disneyland parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3f8hUTUxif-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/3f8hUTUxif-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noooo!!! Hopefully not, anyway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to pretend that Coco&#39;s the old Sambo&#39;s and will be sure to go there. Gotta keep the old memories alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m keeping my mouth shut at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/off-to-anaheim-california-this-is-travelwear-finding-calm-and-something-to-eat-in-a-sea-of-people-buddy-can-you-spare-a-screen/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The travel bug is incurable. Once it&#39;s in you, any daily routine that doesn&#39;t involve leaving the house early and exploring new surroundings just doesn&#39;t cut it. So after 3 weeks of trying to find something new in the city of my birth, I jumped at the chance to cash in some air miles and head for the airport again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite daughter Robyn is heading off to VidCon, the annual YouTube conference in Anaheim, California. Her friend and travel companion couldn&#39;t afford the trip this year but Robyn was determined to go. She&#39;s not really comfortable travelling alone however, so I&#39;m going as a roommate and Chief Transportation Officer. My main role as CTO is convincing her to walk around Anaheim even though it&#39;s 30C+ every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I booked my flight two days before leaving, I couldn&#39;t get the same flight as Robyn. Not the same airline either. Or even the same connecting city. So while Robyn flew to Los Angeles via Calgary, I took the longer route and headed east to Minneapolis. I had the opportunity to go to the airport at 4AM to catch my flight too. Take my word for it, Regina sure is lovely and peaceful at 4AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&#39;t get over the difference in how people dress in North America vs. Europe. My frumpy shirt and baggy pants make me the well dressed one here! The plane to Minneapolis was full of ball caps, t-shirts (not always covering bellies) and shorts. There was one guy in his 50&#39;s wearing pale khaki short shorts with a black Motley Crüe t-shirt stretched over his belly. At 4AM! But at least he has a black leather bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got caught up listening to 4 younger folks talking before we boarded. Two are off to Detroit to watch 3 baseball games in 2 1/2 days. Another man (in a suit, by the way) was off to Calgary, while a woman was going to her second house in Phoenix. She was 45 at most. She and her husband sold the house and now they were putting the furniture in storage while they looked for a different house. Flip and grow, I guess. I seem to have chosen a different path. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t deal with either fashion / lifestyle extreme, to be honest. The race for stuff and houses to put them in, or the general &amp;quot;I Work On The Rigs&amp;quot; look. I know I&#39;m being an anti prairie-ist, but there were very few people on the plane with whom I felt comfortable striking up a conversation. Maybe I was just tired and missing my partner in travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fe387rYf0c-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fe387rYf0c-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing my travel companion. A seat was available too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Spain, everyone dressed like an architect or an industrial designer. They couldn&#39;t all be architects, but still. I&#39;d much rather talk to someone who is well dressed than hope against hope that the Gold&#39;s gym gorilla boarding behind me sits down before my row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is though, I really love travelling. I even love airports, so long as I have a lot of time. I love wandering around the shopping area, buying an incredibly expensive coffee, and people watching. And you&#39;re not going to find a more diverse and eclectic group of people than at a major hub airport in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harried mothers with a bevy of young babes in tow, all eating a messy chocolate donut and then rolling on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of every nationality with fashion proportional to the distance from Minneapolis (the further away, the nicer the clothes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young sales types, looking dashing and serious and trying to exude success, walking with their middle aged mentors, who still have the dress but have softened significantly around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And everyone, I mean everyone, either sleeping, &amp;quot;doing business&amp;quot; on the phone or gazing, deep and unblinking, into the blue glow of their smartphones. If, heaven forbid, one is too poor or too forgetful to bring a phone, all the seats at the gate have tablets for some last minute deep gazing before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iK0B8Zig8U-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/iK0B8Zig8U-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gates in Minneapolis have tables with tablets, just in case you forgot your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a three hour layover in Minneapolis, but when I booked my flights Cindy noticed that the connection home is very tight. I&#39;ll have 30 minutes to get from the LA plane to my plane home to Regina and Minneapolis is very large indeed. So I checked arrivals and departures board to get the lay of the land. If the gates are consistent (and these are daily flights so I bet they are) it&#39;s going to be a challenge to make my connection. We&#39;re talking two opposing wings of the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having time to kill, I did a dry run and timed myself from gate to gate. Through a combination of one flight of stairs, moving sidewalks, a tram and speed walking, I made it gate to gate in just over 9 minutes. So if I can get off the plane in 10 minutes, then run like hell with an empty bladder, I should make it before they close the gate with a minute to spare. To be safe, I tried to upgrade my return ticket to sit near the front, but it&#39;s not allowed on my Air Miles redemption. I shall have to try over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/AsU1c0x3M5-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/AsU1c0x3M5-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many, many hallways like this between my gate from LA and the one to Regina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
I blame my overly polite Canadian-ness for a mistake I made on the second leg of my flight. The flight was full, and the overhead bins were going to be over stuffed, so the gate attendants asked for people to volunteer to check their bags. Since I had two hours to kill at LAX waiting for Robyn&#39;s flight to arrive, I volunteered.
&lt;p&gt;The problem came when I went to collect my bag before finding a place for lunch. Once I arrived at the baggage carousel I realized that I had passed out of the secure area. The secure area was also the area with all the restaurants. A slice of Banana Bread from Starbucks was my lunch and early supper until I hiked across the airport to find Robyn&#39;s terminal, she landed, we found a shuttle bus and made our way to our hotel in Anaheim. I made it, but will be packing an apple with me for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just in case I was feeling too cozy as the new Hemingway of the travel scene, ready to run with the bulls or get into the ring to wrestle Mickey Mouse, the young lady at the Starbucks called me sweetie. I don&#39;t think my hunky action hero appearance is working here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Way Back Is Shorter</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People do it all the time. I know that. And yet our 8 hour flight to Europe was one of the longest and most difficult journeys I&#39;ve ever taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard on the mind and body to fly all night, trying to sleep while sitting upright, then finally landing in a bustling major airport in a foreign country. You&#39;re tired, sluggish and disoriented. The signs don&#39;t make a lot of sense. Everyone&#39;s in a rush, but it&#39;s unclear what they are rushing toward, or away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TjUtqeNr8w-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/TjUtqeNr8w-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re here! Figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Lisbon, it took us at least 20 minutes to figure out how to buy a train ticket to our apartment. How hard can it be? Money can only go in so many slots, after all. But the first decision in a new country takes on a ridiculously huge importance. I&#39;ll easily blow five euros on the wrong drink on Day 10, but spending a euro too much on the first train is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness for adrenaline. The physical fatigue of a sleepless night is more than balanced by the excitement of a new adventure. On the way out, pure adrenaline goes a long way to getting you where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first few days, we&#39;re settled in to a new routine. Get up, eat, walk around. Every few days, move on. It&#39;s a wonderful, invigorating, sustainable groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as soon as our route faces home again, a switch flips in my brain. Living in the present is no longer enough. Thoughts of home and the future flood in and time speeds up. When we returned to Amsterdam for our final leg of our trip, I felt like I was killing time until our plane left in four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/mYjV1fr97x-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/mYjV1fr97x-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how, but this had me thinking of home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And time just kept speeding up. That same eight hour flight home felt like a drive to Saskatoon, except with two meals. Just like that, we&#39;re home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this new accelerated pace is all in my head. I&#39;m jacked up, I can&#39;t sleep, but all around me is slow. The grass grew, but not that much. That pile of laundry is still sitting in the hamper. There&#39;s nobody out on the street. It&#39;s hot like an August scorcher, but the peonies haven&#39;t even bloomed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s taken a week to get over the time travel and match the pace of the world around me. To get a good night&#39;s sleep; to not just bolt up at sunrise and pace about. To hang out in the afternoon like the dog and the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the evening, to plan out the next trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://carolynmark.com/&quot;&gt;Carolyn Mark&lt;/a&gt; for inspiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.spotify.com/track/4lVKUyBhu8vyq5tQfmQkg4&quot;&gt;the title&lt;/a&gt;. I sing her songs often and with gusto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just realized the photo and video were messed up on yesterday&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/welcome-back/&quot;&gt;Welcome Back&lt;/a&gt; post. It&#39;s fixed now. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

I still dream about living here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We arrived home safe and sound on Monday night and aside from stronger than expected jet lag (I&#39;m still getting up at 5AM then collapsing in bed by 9pm,) things are good. We&#39;re heading out for walks every day, Cindy&#39;s putting our house back together and I&#39;m either lining up meetings and visits with people or generally worrying. Back to normal all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing has been happening consistently that is taking a while to get used to again. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who we pass on the street says &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;good morning&amp;quot; to us. Every single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I was walking alone down Argyle Road at 7:30AM, when the only other person on the street passed me with a hearty &amp;quot;Good Morning!&amp;quot; I was shaken awake and found my manners in reply at the last possible moment before I could be classed as rude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve slowly had my manners worked out of me in Europe. Even when we were cycling in Holland and would pass another cyclist, they wouldn&#39;t even make eye contact. Not even if we were the first person they passed in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in March, our host in Evora, Portugal told us about a trip she took to Calgary. She asked if it was our &amp;quot;costume&amp;quot; in Canada to say hello to strangers on the street, because that&#39;s what everyone did to her in Calgary. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot this week about Maria as I get used to our customs again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also had several people replace &amp;quot;Good Morning&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Welcome Back&amp;quot; which has been very disconcerting. I mean, when I recognize the person it&#39;s one thing, but this morning two men passed us in the park and said &amp;quot;Welcome Back&amp;quot; and I had no idea who they were. But one fellow said he was following this blog so knew we were home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continued the walk, I muttered something about how I was surprised that people I don&#39;t know well were reading this blog. At which point Cindy hit me and said I just needed to stop worrying and keep writing. She does that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog for one person. Our friend Deborah asked if I&#39;d be writing about the trip and I thought it would be fun to send dispatches home. But I never imagined so many people would be following along. Thanks for reading and commenting and emailing and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks, Deborah. We&#39;ll come visit soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep writing, here, there and everywhere. I&#39;ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. I just realized Cindy filmed that crazy hand-crank Dutch bike ferry &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/holland/&quot;&gt;I told you about&lt;/a&gt;. Here it is...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Holland:  Rime of the Ancient Cyclists</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.&amp;quot; - &lt;em&gt;Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&lt;/em&gt; Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holland is the land of the bicycle. I read it from home, read it again on the plane from Venice, but learned it first hand at David&#39;s Burgers in Leiden, Netherlands on Saturday night. As we waited for our burgers to get grilled up, I sat and watched the cyclists negotiate the T intersection; left to the train station, right to the University, and right then left over the bridge across one of the many canals that striped the city centre. I watched groups of young boys, young women in pairs and alone, old couples, families with two kids in the front. I even saw several riders hauling a friend sitting side saddle on the back rack. One girl straddled the front rack, facing the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/X7qjSDHWSA-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/X7qjSDHWSA-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leiden, Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My favourite was a young couple who were clearly on a date. Both were impeccably dressed, although the boy (who was driving) had a large pack on his back that his date needed to avoid, since she was sitting on the back rack, holding her purse on her lap and eating a banana with her free hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PLxGQEIfGz-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/PLxGQEIfGz-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike parking is hilarious. There are way, way more bikes already parked than there are people in the town. There are racks everywhere. Many are double decker racks too. Rows and rows of them, throughout the town. And at any point in time they are 80% - 90% full, so people just park their bikes in the general vicinity of the racks. Most Dutch bikes have a quick and easy wheel lock that renders the bike useless when locked, so you don&#39;t have to actually lock the bike to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with all these bikes around us, picturesque towns all close together, and hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of smooth paved bike paths around us (over 7000km in the Netherlands as a whole), you&#39;d think it would be easy to rent a bike, right? Not for us, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were looking for bikes and saddlebags to carry our clothes while we rode from town to town. But while bikes are available at every train station, they don&#39;t rent bags. And the places that might have bags to rent or buy were closed for their May long weekend. Argh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did find one place in Leiden that could fit the bill. Budget Bikes (now there&#39;s a warning for you) was open on holiday Monday and had bikes and bags. At least I think they had bikes to rent. It said so on the window. But when we went inside the nice but shockingly dim young men had a really hard time coming up with two bikes to rent. They pulled one out of the back garage, and finally went through their stock of questionable used bikes for the second bikes. The bikes were old and clunky but the chains weren&#39;t too rusty so we gave them a go. But they were way too small, no matter how high we raised the seats. After a couple of hours of riding my knees and back were screaming at me as, hunched and dejected, I finally found the bike shop again and gave back the bikes. No way could we ride these for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we explored Leiden on foot. It&#39;s an extremely picturesque little university town, 30km or so southwest of Amsterdam. Brown row houses lining cute little canals. Lots of good looking young people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/qrursxd55v-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/qrursxd55v-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the shocking aspects of Holland is how expensive everything is, from food to clothes to accommodations. Especially accommodations. In Leiden, we stayed at a minor hotel so far out of town that it was right on the border of the next town and it was still our most expensive stay so far (it would seem cheap in a week.) It was a good long hike into the city centre, but there was an intercity bus that ran straight past the hotel, along the highway to The Hague, so we caught that if the weather threatened rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, we found that things in the Netherlands cost 1.5x to 2x what things cost in Italy, which was already 1.5x the prices in Portugal. Bus and train fare was double. Meals? Double. That 6 euro breakfast for two in Lisbon was 15 euros in Leiden. Lunch ran 20 - 30 euros. And supper? We tried to avoid restaurant suppers when we could, or did our &#39;two appetizers and a shared main&#39; thing to manage our cash. We were here two weeks and had to make our funds last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodations were a challenge throughout. Not just the cost (which was routinely 50% - 100% more than anywhere else bar Paris), but availability. The Netherlands in general, and Holland in particular, is booked. The days of carefree Mediterranean travel, where we booked a room the night before arriving, and paid half or less than our benchmark (the Park Town Hotel in Saskatoon) were over. Now we paid like the Park Town and stayed in the Super 8. But there were a few lucky exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to these bikes. After the long weekend had passed, we took the bus to The Hague, figuring that the larger city would have a place that rented bikes and bags. But after a day of walking from bike shop to bike shop and finding only one shop that rented bags as well (a hippy run coffee shop whose owner insisted he had &#39;great bikes&#39; in the basement), we decided to loop back to Amsterdam and go to the first bike shop I&#39;d emailed from Italy. They had bikes, bags, and would store our suitcases while we toured. So the next morning we took the train to Amsterdam, got the bikes, and took them on the train back to Leiden. Then we rode the bikes back to The Hague, experiencing the Netherlands bike route junction network for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xXuOVuT-nN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/xXuOVuT-nN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the coolest thing. As I mentioned, there are over 7000km of paved bike lanes all over the Netherlands. The larger paths are part of the junction network, a spider web of paths that connect every town and village in the country. Armed with a map of South Holland, we could trace a path anywhere we wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/SaYc0s6bg8-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/SaYc0s6bg8-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how they work. Every major bike path intersection is given a number. There&#39;s a sign at the intersection with the number, plus arrows giving directions to the next junctions. For example, if I&#39;m at junction 70, the sign will say go left to get to #68, right to #53, and keep going straight to #71. So all I have to do to get from Leiden to The Hague, for example, is write down all the junction numbers I need to pass through, in order, then connect the dots as I ride along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/jr_-wvvmiV-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/jr_-wvvmiV-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not perfect; some of the sign are vague, like when a single arrow points in between my two options at a fork in the road. Or when a low post is buried in extra long grass. Or when road construction, usually around a busy train station when we&#39;re leaving a city, forces a detour around your junction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8c7jSPUtvD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8c7jSPUtvD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blink and you miss it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But we found an app for Cindy&#39;s phone which had the paths marked, if not the junction numbers. So when we left the path we could at least figure out which way to ride to get back on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first ride, from Leiden back to our apartment in The Hague, we retraced the bus route we took the day before for a while, before heading west to the coast. The Hague is very close to the Atlantic Ocean, so we cycled past gorgeous farms, then private villas and mansions, before hitting sand dunes and the coast. Rain was coming quick so we didn&#39;t linger, and we certainly didn&#39;t swim, but it was great to see the ocean, the long sandy beach, and the huge barges off on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hague is a beautiful city, one of our favourites on the whole trip. It&#39;s the seat of government in the Netherlands, (although Amsterdam is the capital; quite different from home) so you&#39;ve got fine government buildings and lots of attractive, prosperous people on the streets. And there&#39;s also a lot of very stunning, unique modern architecture, from the massive, all white City Hall and public library to the funky, new De Resident neighbourhood right beside the historic main square. De Resident is extra cool; they got a different architect to design each apartment building, so each building is unique. But each building also ties into it&#39;s surroundings as well. They act as a bridge between the old city to the west and the modern skyscrapers to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were extremely lucky to find a cheap studio apartment right in the De Resident neighbourhood. We had a great modern flat, with these stunning buildings on one side and the old town on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would&#39;ve easily stayed two more days there but, alas, it was booked. So we spent another half day walking about after our ride from Leiden and headed out the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From The Hague, we rode south and east to Delft. It was a great ride, but cold. Although the clouds threatened all day, we stayed dry for the most part, riding on smooth, straight roads, along beautiful canals and past tidy little farms. Of course, we realized too late we were on the wrong side of one particularly long canal, so rode a few kilometres extra before finding a bridge and doubling back to our hotel. It was a modern place, The Shanghai Hotel Holland no less, but it was an easy ride to Delft town centre once we dropped off our saddlebags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delft is small and charming. It&#39;s known for its blue glazed pottery, which guarantees some tourists, but it&#39;s also a university town, so there&#39;s lots of energy to the place. We spent a delightful afternoon and morning wandering up and down the streets, crossing every bridge and sitting down at as many cafes as we could handle. We found a great mom &amp;amp; pop bakery for coffee and pastries, and also found the square where all the students went for evening coffee. Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we were about to leave Delft, we stumbled across one of the best experiences of the trip. We were crossing the main square, between the large church at one end and the hall at the other, when a newly married couple left the church and cycled over to the hall, followed by the wedding party and all the guests. All were dressed up, carrying blue and white balloons, and all were riding bikes. The lovely bride was in a cart in front of the lead bike, pedalled by the groom. In the background, the church carillon played wedding melodies while the bride and groom did two loops of the square then led the entire procession into the hall. It was elegant, teary-eye romantic and very, very Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Delft we rode on to Rotterdam, one of the largest modern port cities in the world. But you wouldn&#39;t know it from the ride; we spent a cloudy and rainy morning cycling through &lt;em&gt;polders&lt;/em&gt;, the low fields that are completely surrounded by canals and are actually lower than the larger canals that run along side. Most of the polders had two or three cows, or some sheep and lambs, or maybe a few goats, all lazily grazing on the lush green grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canals were a blast. I&#39;ve never seen so much wildlife so close before. We cycled past families of ducks who had nests in the middle of the water, or wedged into the bank. We saw huge white swans, many geese and even several great blue herons, just doing their thing in the water. They weren&#39;t scared of us at all. Heck, I got scared when we&#39;d ride past some tall grass and an unseen duck quacked right by my foot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotterdam is another of our very favourite cities. The combination of waterfront and crazy modern architecture is exceptional. It reminds me of a quiet version of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out hotel in Rotterdam was right downtown, on the canal, on a converted barge no less. We were right near all the action and breakfast was included. Excellent! We locked up the bikes and spent the next few days wandering around this beautiful city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was just up the road at the Markthal, Dutch for Market Hall. Holy Cow, what a place! Cindy read that at one point the Dutch were concerned that the European Union would outlaw open air markets (as if!) so in typical Dutch fashion they fixed things by building a massive, 10 story tall dome and put the market inside. The ends of the dome are just clear glass, but the sides are 10 floors of apartments and restaurants, that curve around the dome. I still can&#39;t get over this structure; I can&#39;t even decide if it looks better from the outside or the inside! But the food inside is amazing and the restaurants are very good too. There&#39;s even a Jamie Oliver Italian restaurant there that seems very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Markthal has permanent stalls inside, there&#39;s still a massive twice weekly outdoor market on the square beside. So as it was now Saturday we checked that out too. Lots of fruit, meat, fish and cheese, along with all the household items and clothes that fill out these markets. I chickened out though and passed by the haring (herring) stand, although I watched a few locals eat the cured fish, smothered in raw onions, in two big bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the square from the Markthal is the Rotterdam Public Library, one of the best libraries I&#39;ve ever been in. Even better than Bologna. Not only are there a ton of books and other media, but there&#39;s a pretty good coffee shop too. It&#39;s full of cookbooks so you can read while enjoying a drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know that I&#39;m a big fan of libraries. 10+ years after stopping the planned shrinkage of the Regina library system, I&#39;m worried we&#39;ve stagnated a bit at home. I was encouraged by some of the cool modern libraries I saw in European cities big and small, but especially in Rotterdam. It&#39;s in a great location, is in an amazing building, and has a ton of places to sit and work. And you know what? It&#39;s busy! We could barely find a seat to read and write in the six floors we checked out. I guess if you make a comfortable space to read and work, people will use it. Time to get busy at home...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one day on our stay in Rotterdam, we left the city via the water-bus and travelled just outside of town to Kinderdijk. It was time to figure out windmills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/pzNRMpmYZ9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the modern architecture in Rotterdam is because they had to rebuild the city after bombing in World War 2. But the bombs missed Kinderdijk and there are still rows of windmills dating from the 1740&#39;s there. We walked along the polders and went inside two windmills to learn more about how they worked and what it was like to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windmill operator lived in the mill permanently, with his family. In one windmill, the operator lived with his wife and thirteen children! It was a tough life and things changed only recently. Windmill operators lived in the windmills up to the 1950&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RzfFkK3fXR-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RzfFkK3fXR-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s how they work. Remember how I mentioned that the polders are lower than the surrounding land? Well, the windmills help keep the polders from filling back up with water. A row of windmills sits on a narrow strip of land between the polder canals and a higher canal. When the wind blows, the windmill turns a big wheel that literally scoops the water from the lower polder canal and throws it up into the higher canal. Then, another set of windmills throw the water from the higher canal up even higher, into the Lek River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right, all the land is lower than the level of the river! It&#39;s fascinating engineering, but it really brings home how the Dutch have literally built their country. Most of Holland would be a large inland sea if it weren&#39;t for all this moving water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday morning was rainy, but we had booked rooms up the road, so we bundled up and set out for our next destination, Gouda. Land of cheese, but with many more names than just &#39;Gouda.&#39; The ride was hard; even though there&#39;s a finite amount of &#39;wet&#39; one can get, it&#39;s pretty cold riding. But after around an hour and a half of riding, the rain stopped and we slowly dried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the day&#39;s ride was just outside of Gouda, when we rode past a community garden. But this was much more than a collection of garden plots. Each plot had a large shed/small cottage that was clearly made for the gardener. A place to hang out as he tended his crops. Many of the plots looked more like small yards than a mere vegetable patch. We wandered around and checked things out and took pictures of the sheds. Hopefully I can build one at home and turn it into a writing studio. With a day bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gouda was yet another picture perfect little town with a shop lined centre, lots of canals and in this case, a very ornate old town hall right in the middle of the square. While it looked pretty large to me, the hall is too small for a town as important as Gouda, I guess, so they built a new town hall just outside the centre. Surprisingly, it&#39;s designed to remind one of a stroopwaffel. Not cheese. That&#39;s because the cinema, right next door, already looks like cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the cheesy time we had, we did actually find a very, very good cheese shop in Gouda. We got some lessons on how to pick a good cheese, ate far too many samples, then picked up a few wedges for our packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Gouda, we headed north and west to another University town, Utrecht. It was a fun ride - no rain - but the clouds were threatening all day and we were buffeted by a strong crosswind. The land wasn&#39;t a lowland polder fest, instead it was much more park-like, and it was as green and as full of wildlife as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just kept tracking our junction points, stopping for a snack now and then, and in a few hours we were at our new apartment. But not until we negotiated some major construction work, right around the train station, of course, and at rush hour. In Holland, rush hour means a lot of cars but even more bikes, so it was a very, very crowded bike lane for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utrecht was a really fun town. We rented a traditional Dutch home, a very comfortable, narrow row house with steep, twisty stairs and a small back garden. It belongs to Solveig, a very nice young woman who is studying at the University. We had a great visit when we arrived and learned a bit about the Dutch post-secondary school system. There are three types of Universities depending on the type of courses, which explains how everywhere we went was a &#39;University Town.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architectural highlight about Utrecht, aside from the excellent library (why are all Dutch libraries so awesome?) is the Dom Tower. It&#39;s the highest bell tower in the Netherlands, even though it&#39;s no longer attached to a church! It used to be connected to a very large cathedral, but a large storm in the 1600&#39;s destroyed half the church, right in the middle. The Protestants, who ran the church at the time, figured it was a Sign that the church was too gaudy, so left the centre in ruins. Now the centre has been cleaned up and is the delightful Dom Square, an open square between the tower and the remaining church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give guided tours of Dom Tower and we took one. It&#39;s very good. The tower is so big that we stopped on three levels to learn about what was going on. Not just up then down like in Siena. The first two levels are private chapels, and the top two levels contain all the bells. Both 14 large bells, of which seven still remain from 1502, and a 40+ bell carillon that can played like a very large organ. The carillon can be played by a musician, but is also connected to a large wheel that plays a melody every 15 minutes. The melodies can be programmed much like a paper reel on a player piano, but with large metal pins and the tune changes over the year. We were told that the new carillon player in town is young and modern and will even play rock tunes on the bells when she has a concert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this leg of the trip was cycling, so we didn&#39;t linger for too long in any one city. But we did get a full day and night in Utrecht, which meant we walked back to the centre that night for a &#39;Utrecht by night&#39; walking tour. Students have set up light displays throughout the centre that run after sunset (around 9:45pm in May) and there&#39;s a walking route to see them all. Some lights are on buildings, some in the trees and others are under bridges along the canals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UDep25CrDs-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/UDep25CrDs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the light displays aren&#39;t too spectacular, the walking loop is a lot of fun. Tiny illuminated arrows are placed in the cobblestone sidewalks every so often, marking the route. They are far enough apart that you really have to look for them, and on quiet, nearly deserted streets in a Medieval town centre, it can get a little spooky. And there was a big payoff at the final point of the tour: the Dom Tower was lit spectacularly, right at the very top of the 95 metre tower. Right at the top of the hour, the lights went out, then the carillon played for a long time as the lights came back on and swirled and danced over the face of the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our final ride of our Holland loop, from Utrecht back to the bike shop in Amsterdam, we finally got some sunshine. Eight days of cloud and intermittent showers, plus one day of just plain rain, was making the bike rides a bit of work. But this day the sun was out and the sky was blue (well, blue-ish) as we set off on the bike path. Our route took us away from the highway and even away from farms; today we were in cottage country. We rode along large lakes filled with small yachts and lined by very fine cottages. Some were all out villas. Ahoy, rich folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our best ride of the trip, even though it was the longest. Only 30km by car, the windy bike path is much longer, but much more beautiful, so it took us five hours to get to Amsterdam. But it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the canals seemed completely dedicated to cyclists. At one point, there was a manual &#39;bikes only&#39; ferry to get us across the canal! We loaded our bikes on, then turned a crank again and again to pull the ferry across the canal. What fun! At another crossing we once again needed a ferry, but we were now crossing the Amstel river so there was a proper boat and driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there we were. Amsterdam. One second we were riding down a country lane, then we crossed a bridge, turned a corner and saw a stack of glass skyscrapers. We made it. By this point we blended in fairly well with the locals, screaming down our bike lane, turning corners without flinching, and cursing out tourists who kept walking in &#39;our&#39; lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final three blocks to the bike shop, deep in the heart of Damstraat and tourist central, was a little hairy, but we made it, returned the bikes, reclaimed our suitcases, blended in with the hoards and found a tram to our final AirBnb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has a tourist problem, and they know it. The &#39;Old Town&#39; area between the Central train station and Damstraat is completely, utterly clogged with tourists and weed smoking hippies. It&#39;s not a lot of fun down there; maybe 25 years ago, but not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ELiH1Yvvnp-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had a great display at the library (another winner - what is it with Dutch libraries?!) about the tourist problem in the Old Town. They see how tourism is only growing and they have to choose between being like Venice (the city as museum and nobody can live there anymore) or New York (lots of tourists but people live and work in Manhattan too.) And they have the building plans to change things too. It was cool to see such forward thinking about their city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as crowded as it is, get outside this 5-10 block area and the city opens up amazingly. Literally, just go from this block where you can&#39;t even see the buildings for people, walk across the bridge and go one block and it&#39;s peace, quiet and locals. So that&#39;s what we did. Even when we had to go &#39;across town&#39;, we steered around the centre instead of going through, and had a delightful three days in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still took a while to warm up to Amsterdam though. Too many thoughts about heading home, too many realizations that this would be my last good coffee, or Cindy&#39;s last poffertje (tiny pancake treat) to enjoy what was in front of us. Plus I got a nasty flu bug on our first day and was too dizzy to ride the tram into the city; it took a day to get fit enough to walk around. But finally, on Sunday, our last full day in Europe, we figured Amsterdam out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started in Vondelpark, a large, pedestrian/cyclist only park in the middle of the city. Seeing so many people out enjoying the day shook the gloom off my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the good vibes continued as we walked along lovely tree-lined streets, with a canal in the middle and tight, narrow, crooked row houses running the length of the block. We stopped in bakeries, took a good look at what everyone was eating for brunch, and window shopped for shoes and a new suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we turned the corner and fell in love. We had reached the Museum Quarter, with a gorgeous concert hall at one end, the massive Riksmuseum at the other, and the ultra-modern Van Gogh Museum in the middle. Beside the Van Gogh museum was a huge green space, and behind that, an exceptionally cool open air antique market. And within the market, was the coolest trio of street food vendors ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VvYAFO2xOE-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VvYAFO2xOE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, served with a glass of wine too, because we&#39;re in Europe and it&#39;s a civilized place. Not only will the world not end if you have a glass of wine in the park on a Sunday afternoon, but maybe your Sunday afternoon will be just a little better. A little more awesome. A little more perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was for us. So perfect that we enjoyed every bite, savoured every sip, and felt a connection with every soul who was sitting in the park with us on a cool, grey, gorgeous day in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we cried a few happy tears, went back to our apartment and started packing. Tomorrow we go home.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Veneto: Great Food and New Friends</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m from where food is grown. Maybe not all the food I want to eat (I love a good orange), but still. Meat, grains, vegetables. We feed people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s a special place in my heart to visit places where the food is grown. And in Italy, it&#39;s grown everywhere. But nowhere more than in the Veneto. Our friend and baker Giacomo was from the Veneto and told us so many stories of his homeland that we just had to go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Bologna, which is actually a little south of the Veneto, in Emilia-Romangna. It&#39;s known as the food capital of Italy, genesis of the entire &amp;quot;Slow Food&amp;quot; movement. It&#39;s the home of tortellini, mortadella (aka &amp;quot;baloney&amp;quot; at home), tagliatelle and, of course, bolognese sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BeL8duqIxe-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BeL8duqIxe-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all true, but I&#39;ll remember Bologna as the City of the Portico. Most all the buildings in the old city centre have porticos on all sides; arched coverings that extend over the terrazzo sidewalks. If it&#39;s raining, and country this green must get a lot of it, you can walk all through the centre without getting wet. One portico is over 3km long. Legend has it that it was built to transport a statue of the Virgin Mary between the church and the square; after years of it always raining on festival day, the town fathers built the world&#39;s longest portico for a permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G8P5vUvPKp-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/G8P5vUvPKp-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our apartment in Bologna was one of the best of the trip. A cozy rooftop flat tucked into the top corner of a large block, requiring us to pass through three iron gates and cross two passages with open views of the centre courtyard to get to our door. But inside we had a modern kitchen, a low ceiling sitting room, the most comfortable bed of the trip, and window that opened to the sky above. Even with all the sights in Bologna, I needed two afternoon naps in that cool, breezy bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8ISL-Q3gpd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporary bakery set up in the square beside our flat. Baking traditional cookies and bread as a fundraiser. I found it by smell!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flat was right beside the main food district, the Quadrilatero, so we walked down there straight away. The narrow four block area has been the food hub of Bologna since Roman times and it&#39;s still going strong. It&#39;s filled with fancy shops selling perfect fruits and vegetables, fresh pasta, cheese, oil, meat and fish. We saw our first butcher specializing in horse meat (a delicacy in northern Italy) although we didn&#39;t have the guts to try any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RlQX1NaxvM-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RlQX1NaxvM-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the label!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food here is the most expensive we had seen in Italy, but it was so fresh, and presented so well, that we didn&#39;t have any objections to loading up our shopping bags and cooking this great food in our apartment for two meals. There are also many excellent restaurants in the area, but when the food in the shops is that good, I just have to cook. Bags of fresh tomatoes, garlic and zucchini, plus lovingly wrapped parcels of fresh pasta and wedges of the best parmigiano made their way up to our room. We feasted that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q3bsk9ieMN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/q3bsk9ieMN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s awesome just how many of what you think of as &#39;Italian Food&#39; came from around Bologna. Aside from pizza, almost all of it. The city of Parma, home of parmigiano reggiano cheese and Parma ham, is just down the road. Modena, where all the best balsamic vinegar comes from is right there too. What a delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/dy4Qt9xt7T-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is beautiful too. We explored it in depth thanks to Robyn&#39;s &amp;quot;Walking in Italy&amp;quot; book. Setting aside the miles of porticos for a moment, Bologna also has a huge, interesting main square, anchored with a massive statue of Neptune in the middle (even though the city is far inland.) It also has two huge towers in the city centre, so tall, so narrow and with such drastic leans to them that I was too scared to climb them. Although Cindy braved the climb and took some great pictures to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main square also has the best public library of the trip so far. It sits inside the Sala Borsa, the former seat of the civic government, and you can see even older ruins through glass floors on the main level. It&#39;s popular with readers and a major tourist attraction as well. Come on, Regina, get going with the public buildings already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day, we left the centre of town for a walk in two local parks. Two, because we started off in the wrong direction and found an open &#39;wilderness&#39; park high on a hill outside the old town. It was nice, but a little too remote for our lazy day plans. So we headed back into town and found the &#39;city&#39; park very close to our apartment, but in the opposite direction from where we started the trip. That was OK though, because the detour took us past our new favourite lunch Cafe. We dined on sandwiches, wine, with fresh strawberries and ice cream for dessert, all from a high patio beside the street. It was a perfect venue to hang out and watch the world drift by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Bologna after stopping at our new favourite gelato shop for breakfast. Hey, when you make unique flavours, in house, from organic ingredients, and get recognition from the &#39;slow food&#39; folks, and when you&#39;re right across the street from our apartment, you are a perfect gelato shop for breakfast! Gelato then a walk to the train station - talk about leaving you wanting more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Verona on a whim. Our friend Giacomo, who is from the Veneto, sent us a message that said &amp;quot;Verona is nice.&amp;quot; That was enough for us! And you know what? It is nice. Very, very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train ride was very short but intriguing, because the landscape looked a lot like home. We sped through flat, green farmland, just like at home if we still had trains. Sure, many of the farms had grape vines and orchards, but there was wheat too and attractive vegetable gardens. And mountains! The start of the Alps, with Gran Paradiso and the Italian Lakes off in hazy blue distance. They&#39;d have to wait, but on a clear day they set off Verona&#39;s buildings beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know Verona as the setting for Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet. There&#39;s a bit of recognition here; a balcony with a sign &amp;quot;just like Juliet&#39;s&amp;quot; etc. but not too much. What Verona had for us is the Holy Trinity of Awesome European Cities: rivers with lots of bridges; a castle; and a Roman Arena. We spent two wonderful days strolling along the river and trying to figure out the best view of the castle, and touring the local cathedrals. When that got tiring, we&#39;d sit in the town square, sip Spritz (the local specialty) and gaze at the Arena that was smack dab in the middle of the square. It&#39;s in good enough shape that the Arena is still used for operas in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to gloss over the beauty of Verona. It&#39;s awesome. But by this point we were settled into a gentle Italian groove that was so relaxing and so satisfying that I could keep it going forever. Our toughest decisions were selecting the right gelato shop from fifty options, or whether to dine at a small family run pizza shop or the neighbourhood Osteria (we did both!) We found a lovely square near our apartment, and away from the tourist loop, which had enough bars and restaurants to keep us occupied for a week. So long as you knew the Italian words for &#39;horse&#39; and &#39;donkey&#39; in order to navigate the menu, it was smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was bliss. I was in a beautiful country, with amazing scenery and delicious food that was reasonably priced, with friendly people and just enough chaos to keep things interesting. I was with the woman I love. The sun was shining and the river was blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we didn&#39;t think things could get any better. But it did. It got better because we got to meet Giacomo&#39;s mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giacomo grew up in Padua, east of Verona, but his mom Alessandra recently moved to Malcesine, west of Verona, along Lake Garda in the famous Italian Lake District. So on Saturday we packed up and took a train, then a bus to Malcesine to meet her and her partner Angelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcesine is beautiful. The whole lake is, really. It&#39;s a resort lake, for sure. A deep blue lake, surrounded by tall mountains and full of sailboats, windsurfers and very few powerboats. The single highway along the lake was crowded with cars and hundreds of cyclists. Everyone was out in the sun and having fun. The lake is very popular with Germans; most of the signs were in Italian and German and the owner of our hotel spoke better German than English. We even saw some German bakeries in the town. But there was enough pasta and gelato available to confirm we were still in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alessandra is a delightful lady, who misses her son very much. Cindy and I were her connection to her boy so we have many hugs to give him when we get home. And she fed us enough that I&#39;m sure some of the food was for Giacomo too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lovely day together, wandering through the old town, strolling along the lake, eating gelato and comparing Italy to Canada. Alessandra&#39;s English was better than our Italian and we had Google Translate to bridge any gaps. Angelo didn&#39;t speak any English at all, but he spoke sports, so he and I talked football and cycling. We even watched the end of the day&#39;s Giro d&#39;Italia stage on TV together and cheered whenever anyone named Giacomo was mentioned. And I learned that I must cheer for Juventus and never Milan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could only spend one day together, sadly, because Alessandra had to work and we had to get back to Verona for my special splurge of the trip. I saw a poster that the Hellas Verona football club was playing their final home game of the season on Sunday night, against Serie A champions Juventus no less! Since Juventus had already clinched the title, and Verona was guaranteed to be relegated at season&#39;s end, there were still tickets available, and we got two very nice seats in the neutral side of the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1bkxVE6JkK-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1bkxVE6JkK-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was awesome. I&#39;ve never heard so much noise and singing at a sporting event before. The away fans from Torino were extremely loud, singing praise on their Juventus or abuse at the Verona fans. And then the Verona Ultras would reply and the stadium would shake with their booming songs. Thankfully I don&#39;t know enough Italian to understand the words. I assume it was mild, like &amp;quot;Our Team Is A-OK&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bad Luck, Visitors&amp;quot; and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started off rocky for us until we realized that, even though Verona was the home team, there were many, many people in our section who were there to see the champions Juventus. Lots of families with young boys wearing the black and white stripes of their heroes on the visiting team. So we made sure to cheer everyone and not look too happy when the home team spanked the champs 2-1 to end their season on a high. Verona striker Luca Toni, playing his last game as a pro, took a lap of honour after the game and I cheered along; his was the only name I recognized from the home team, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Verona for the second, and final, time on Monday morning, we headed east to Padua. We&#39;d been in the Veneto for a long time now but we still wanted to see some of Giacomo and Martina&#39;s home town. Plus, Padua is just outside Venice, so was a nice stepping stone to the famous lagoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Padua is a beautiful city and well worth a visit on its own. It&#39;s got some amazing architecture, not least is the huge market building that is surrounded by three distinct squares. The building itself is full of market stalls; butchers, bakers, fishmongers, cheesemongers and wine shops and the surrounding squares are full of fruit, vegetables and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/iJsWR8o4u_-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/iJsWR8o4u_-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about these market squares is the variety of what&#39;s on offer. It goes well beyond food. So many of the market stalls, up to half in some cases, are for non-food items. Soap, dishes, small appliances. Clothes too. Racks of shirts. Stacks of denim, or socks, or underwear. Mannequins displaying lingerie even. I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t do it. I&#39;d try horse meat before I&#39;d buy underwear from a market stall. Or even a new outfit. I&#39;m not ready for that yet. But lots of people are, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also blessed with one of the very best gelaterias in Italy (better than Bologna? OK, a tie) right beside our Padua apartment. We couldn&#39;t go there for breakfast, because &amp;quot;La Romana&amp;quot; didn&#39;t open till noon. But we went for several nightcaps, along with 50 or 60 other Padovans, just before the midnight closing time. Even after we met Francesco and Nicolo for a late goodbye beer, we still had time for one last gelato at La Romana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tour d&#39;Giacomo included a bus ride out to the suburbs to visit Pasticceria Paride, the bakery Giacomo worked at before he left Italy. It&#39;s a lovely little place, right in among the residential neighbourhood, with coffee and gelato and croissants and delicious little sweets. After a few attempts with our bad Italian, they figured out why we were so interested in the place, and Paride invited us into the back to watch them work for twenty minutes or so. One of the bakers spoke English so we had a great time comparing equipment, techniques and bakers hours. Paride wanted to know what type of things we made at Orange Boot. He doesn&#39;t make bread, and I think he likes the fancy pastries better, but we got along. Especially after I grinned and complemented him on his chocolate tempering machines. I can&#39;t see how Orange Boot version 3 can exist without them. And gelato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also connected up with Francesco and Nicolo, two friends of Giacomo&#39;s who all lived together in London before Giacomo came to Canada and they returned to Padua. They took us all around the city, taught us the right way to order Spritz and tramezzini (tiny sandwiches) at the bar, and then took us out into the country for an amazing authentic Veneto meal. We talked for hours about life in Italy and they asked a ton of questions about life in Canada. They want to come visit soon. I sure hope they do, so we can show them around Regina like they treated us in Padua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Padua, we went to the Scrovegni Chapel to view the famous frescos by the master Giotti. The entire chapel is covered in a cycle of paintings telling the same bible stories about Jesus and Mary that I learned in Sunday School. Except in this case, the paintings were done in 1305! It was stunning. The paintings were in remarkably good condition; I was surprised to learn that any deteriorating has happened in just the last 100 years, as structures surrounding the chapel were torn down. Now water can damage the paintings from the outside in. But I think some of the exorbitant viewing fee is used to pay for restoration work. I hope so; it&#39;s an amazing space of art and history, and well worth preserving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we went to Venice. One of three tear-inducing, I-can&#39;t-believe we&#39;re-actually-here places on our trip, along with Paris and Odeceixe, Portugal. After all the beautiful places we&#39;ve seen in Italy, I really wasn&#39;t expecting much of a thrill from Venice, but oh boy was I thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it starts before you even get there. The city really is an island, just like they tell you. OK, a series of islands, but they are way out there. The train line crosses more water than you expect before you get to the station. And you can&#39;t really see the city from the train. You cross along the causeway, leave the train, wade through the station along with a thousand other people, then pop out onto the plaza with the Grand Canal, water taxis, those lovely stacked buildings and a Cathedral just right there, staring at you. It&#39;s breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/GN_ZYkR35s-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/GN_ZYkR35s-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice is so tight, so narrow and twisty, and full of canals and bridges and interesting little shops, that it&#39;s almost a requirement to get lost. We spent four hours wandering around the city, based loosely on the route in Robyn&#39;s book. We tried to follow the map but got lost repeatedly, weaving off and on the route the entire way. It was a cool and rainy day, but we went with the flow and always seemed to duck into a bar or restaurant just as the sky opened up. Let it rain - we have Spritz and pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kCa72HMXCY-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/kCa72HMXCY-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique Venetian fashion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here&#39;s a tip. Even if you&#39;re travelling light, like us, consider checking your bags at the train station, rather than lugging them through town. We only stayed one night in the city, so we put a change of clothes in our backpacks and left the rest at the station overnight. It was much easier finding our hotel without lugging bags up and down the bridge steps and dodging fellow tourists. Watch even one newlywed couple try to get back to the trains, with a chivalrous husband lugging two huge suitcases through the alleys of Venice and you&#39;ll forego luggage all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Venice is packed with tourists (and it is &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt;, let me tell you) the vast, vast majority of people head straight to Plaza San Marco and stay there. We went, we walked, and we admired it, but then we left the square and wandered to the edges. It was pretty much empty out there but no less interesting. There are just as many shops, and amazing contemporary art, and excellent coffee, and food too. And you can walk a bit in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/39PFkgAXAe-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/39PFkgAXAe-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead end!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then in the evening, after the busses have gone back to Mestre for the night, we went back to the square and really took it all in. It&#39;s wild. Really, the best formal square of the trip, and we&#39;ve seen a few. It&#39;s just really weighty, heavy and perfectly proportioned, from the clock tower that is huge and solid, to the St. Mark&#39;s Basilica, that is big and gorgeous and shiny and gold in the evening light, to the three rows of buildings and continuous porticos that make up the square, but run at odd angles, so the square really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s heavy enough to be very, very impressive. It&#39;s so heavy, in fact, and so close to the Grand Canal, that you really do get the impression that Venice is sinking. I mean, you pile that much stone on a spot and it&#39;s bound to sink a little, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fdKB-93tO8-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fdKB-93tO8-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our last night in Venice, our last night in Italy in fact, we took it slow. A nice meal of chicken and vegetables and pasta, sharing a table with two delightful Dutch ladies. A gondola ride that went right past our hotel. A stroll along the Grand Canal and past the opera house. Then off to sleep in our romantic old 6 room hotel deep in the Venetian maze. Tomorrow will be a new country and a new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/5CF99W1pSs-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/5CF99W1pSs-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trip is nearly over and the thought of coming home, of no longer travelling, of not having markets and terraces and good coffee and gelato and local fruit has me in a melancholy funk. My mood is the same grey-blue that is all over Venice at dusk. Dusk is the time that you feel the age of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venice feels old. Really old, and tired. More tired than anywhere we&#39;ve been. It&#39;s carried the weight of its citizens for hundreds of years, and now carries the weight of the hoards of tourists. One news agent had a sign saying &amp;quot;Venice Is Not A Theme Park&amp;quot; but honestly, with so many tourists coming through every day, even in this &#39;shoulder season&#39;, it kind of is. There isn&#39;t a single business on street level that isn&#39;t focused on the tourist trade, and I was looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Cnx4x1QXWH-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s the thing about Italy. The place really pulls at you. We came here as tourists and we&#39;re leaving as tourists too, I guess. But it&#39;s just so damn comfortable. Sure there&#39; street history and architecture, I wasn&#39;t here long before I started acting like I lived here. Where&#39;s the hardware store? Where can I buy a toaster? Where&#39;s the bike repair shop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d live and work here in a minute, if I could. Give me a coffee bar, a fruit stand, a gelateria and an Internet connection and I wouldn&#39;t leave my block. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Buongiorno. Il mio nome è Marco. Sì, l&#39;Italia è bella . Vieni a sederti. Hanno po &#39;di vino!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the hot cliffs and beaches and clear blue skies of the Cinque Terre, we headed inland toward Tuscany. Our first stop was Lucca, a hot tip from our bakery friend Elanna. It&#39;s well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ride to Lucca was short but full of interest. We passed through Cararra, home of the marble made famous (to us) by Sarah Richardson and all her decorating shows. An episode isn&#39;t complete until Sarah picks out a slab of Cararra for a countertop or backsplash. Well, it all comes from a single mountain outside this town. We passed the white marble mountain, then through the town with work yards full of marble. Huge blocks that could be used on the Pyramids and row after row of thin slabs, ready for a kitchen or bathroom in Harbour Landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we turned inland, through tall green hills with villages wedged in between the slopes and gardens and fields in the valleys. The land was green, fertile and full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/amCyxEyjp6-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/amCyxEyjp6-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucca itself is unique in that it has an intact city wall, surrounded by a green space and even a moat (ok, a canal) in places. The wall was designed by Leonardo da Vinci, no less, and has never been breached. From the train station outside the walls you need to find a gate through the walls to get into the old town. But the best part is the top of the walls is a long, wide, wonderful walking / running path and park. You can walk around the entire town on top of the wall, and many, many people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_cbZCjEeCT-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_cbZCjEeCT-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the wall is an old medieval village with black slate, twisting cobblestone streets. The only change seems to be the replacement of blacksmiths with gelaterias. A stone lined canal runs through one corner of the town and feeds several public fountains. Locals line up to fill collections of glass water bottles directly from the fountains, even though the tap water is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots and lots of bikes in Lucca. In fact, I bet the number of cyclists outnumber the cars. Our first afternoon in town we had lunch at a tiny cafeteria and watched bike after bike pull up and park at a church next door. After the 30th young woman or man rode up and parked we figured there was something going on. Something stylish because all the cyclists were very well dressed; more for a concert than a workout. Finally we realized that they were all picking up kids from the school beside the church. One by one the parents or grandparents came out of the school with a child in tow. Some kids walked beside mom&#39;s bike, some rode on a rack in the front or the back (or both!). Some came over to the cafeteria for coffee and a cookie. It was the closest thing to when the daycare let out beside our bakery, but with bikes and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still cars, and with all the cars, all the bikes and the complete lack of sidewalks, walking around could get treacherous. Especially near the squares with fountains and odd traffic circles. These spaces gave the best views but also had the biggest risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a cool old bakery in the middle of town that was pretty jammed full of people, but I wedged my way in and bought some bread and focaccia. The baker spoke English so we talked a bit about how it was nice to try &#39;real&#39; focaccia, especially as I made a version at the bakery at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing was that his focaccia was quite a bit different than the &#39;real&#39; focaccia I had in La Spezia, only 30km up the road! The La Spezia version is a little thicker and quite a bit more oily. My new friend in Lucca said his was the Real focaccia, and I preferred it. But I made a note not to beat myself up so much when people tell me I don&#39;t make a &#39;real&#39; German Rye or a &#39;real&#39; Sourdough loaf. There&#39;s as many versions as there are bakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered all around Lucca, through the town and up on the walls. Cindy&#39;s book of walking tours gave us some nice routes so we didn&#39;t miss a square or a church. We even paid to walk up a tower in the middle of town to see the whole town and surrounding countryside. It was beautiful. Brown-red buildings surrounded by green trees and rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had so much fun in Lucca that we decided to stay an extra day, in order to see their Saturday market, even though our apartment was spoken for. So we booked a room in a pension for one night and moved 300 metres to new digs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big mistake. That particular Saturday was a washout. As in, massive Noah style rains. The walk to our room was only three blocks but we were completely drenched. Rather than go to the market (which was cancelled anyway) we hung all our clothes to dry and, after a delicious pizza lunch, stuffed newspapers in our shoes and hoped they&#39;d dry in our cold, damp room. Cindy&#39;s shoes were dry enough to head out for a much needed haircut, and learned that her new favourite stylist has a cousin in Regina. No kidding! We have someone new to call when we get home now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damp but undefeated, we left Lucca on Sunday morning on the train for Pisa. Even without the Leaning Tower, Pisa is an interesting city. It was an ancient maritime powerhouse that collected many riches via trading and menaced the surrounding towns. Many of the castles we visited in the area were fortified to protect the citizenry from attacks from Pisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked our bags at the train station and strolled around Pisa, once again following a route from Robyn&#39;s excellent &amp;quot;Walks in Italy&amp;quot; book. We walked up to the main square the Campo de Miracoli, and saw the famous Leaning Tower and the Cathedral beside it. All the white marble buildings in the square shone against the bright green grass of the square. It was cloudy outside, but I could imagine how the buildings would stand out against a bright blue sky too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon got freaked out by the crowds of people in the square, though. It was jammed with people all doing the same thing - posing for pictures. Either selfies with those infernal sticks or three thousand people doing the exact same &amp;quot;hold up the tower&amp;quot; pose. This often required the camera person to sit on the ground, across the sidewalk from the poser, to get the angle just right. And boy did they get mad when you walked in front of them! At least the first 500 people did. Then I walked behind the posers to photobomb as many selfie shooters as I could before Cindy got mad at me and we left the square. Well, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of Pisa outside of Campo dei Miracoli was pretty much deserted, so we had a delightful afternoon following the route in Robyn&#39;s book. We walked up the Arno River, then crossed the bridge and walked down it. We went through Girabali square for gelato. And we found a delightful little park surrounded by restaurants for lunch. We actually went in one block to a tiny pizza restaurant where we were the only English speakers in the place. Only long tables of locals out for Sunday lunch, chowing down on pizza or these immense focaccia sandwiches, that were as big around as a pizza but three times as thick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full and footsore, we walked back to Pisa Centrale station, collected our bags, and hopped on our train to Florence. We had booked an AirBnb apartment just outside of the city centre, right near the tram station. We met our host Frederica, got the keys and settled in for the next four nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Florence, I realized I didn&#39;t really know what I wanted to see there. I had always wanted to see the Duomo, that large red dome that towers over the rest of the city, but beside that, I didn&#39;t have a lot of ideas. Thankfully, Robyn&#39;s book came to the rescue. We spent two delightful days trekking through the streets, alleys and parks of central Florence, walking along and across the Arno River (upstream from Pisa), sitting in the delightful little squares, having gelato at Vivoli (as seen on &amp;quot;I&#39;ll Have What Phil&#39;s Having&amp;quot;) and walking through the large central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Florence provided many &amp;quot;bests&amp;quot; of the trip so far. Best espresso macchiato, from the Grand Cafe beside the Plaza San Marco. Best leather jacket hard sell, from the vendor in &#39;leather alley&#39; (I looked fabulous, but 300 euros was way outside my budget.) Best hard sell leather bag (150 euros, still too much) from the same block of stalls. And the best loaf of bread on the trip, bar none, from Pank, upstairs at the central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upstairs of the market is very interesting. It&#39;s been turned into an upstairs food court, but from what I could tell, they are all connected. Sort of a big food family. I know I poo-pooed a similar setup in my Lisbon post, but at least this was a complement to a real market, not a replacement. And it had a real, proper bakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a ciabatta loaf which looked nothing like any ciabatta I&#39;d ever seen. It was baked really dark and looked more like a flat loaf of bread rather than a flatbread, if you follow me. The bakery was open for viewing so Cindy and I sat for an hour on high stools in front of the oven and watched the baker do his thing, baking off deck after deck of long pizza breads that were baked with tomato sauce, then topped by the sandwich prep baker and baked again before serving. Everything from the bread, to the baker, to the counter staff was awesome. They were all pros, 100%. We ate an excellent apricot tart and watched everyone work like a well oiled machine, like Orange Boot on our best days, then told them how great they were and headed out. Later on, when we ate the ciabatta on a church bench, we wished we&#39;d bought more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Florence we caught a bus to Fiesole, a hill town just outside of the city. It had amazing views of the entire city as well as the valley around Florence, but the highlight of the day was the extensive Estruscan and Roman ruins. We walked for an hour around the excavated baths and temples before having lunch sitting in the Roman theatre, which is in good enough shape that they still hold concerts there in the summer. Then we walked through a really excellent museum where they displayed Estruscan, Roman and Longobard (ie, Lombards, the Germanic folks who came after the Romans) artifacts that have been found at the site and around Fiesole. This included several Longobard tombs which were exhumed and moved to the museum intact. A little creepy but extremely interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Florence we moved on to San Gimignano, a small medieval hill town in the heart of Tuscany, where I am writing this now. It took a little doing to get here - a train to Poggibonsi, 11km away, then a somewhat harrowing bus ride up the hill to the gates of the old town. But from the moment we got off the bus we&#39;ve been in love. It&#39;s simply stunning here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really got those Scotiabank RRSP ads where 50-somethings exclaim &amp;quot;we can afford that villa in Tuscany!&amp;quot; but now I do. This is serious upper-middle class adult Disneyland here, except it&#39;s real. High, rolling hills all around you that are impossibly green. Vineyards off in every direction, growing Chianti grapes or the lovely Vernaccia white wine grapes. Rows of tall, thin cyprus trees lining the country lanes. Olive orchards where there aren&#39;t grapes. Red brick villas dotting the countryside. An beautiful wild poppies in the every ditch and around every fence post. Holy cow it&#39;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent two sunny days exploring the hills around San Gimignano. We&#39;d leave after breakfast and descend down from the town, through vineyards and past impressive villas, stopping only to admire the views, take a few more pictures, and wonder if some of the old stone shacks were for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day was a winding 14km hike to the neighbouring town of Certaldo. We followed a meandering route along a ridge line through the hamlet of Pasole before finally descending down to Certaldo. It was a gorgeous walk till we hit the town; the final kilometre or so was along a busy highway. Then we rode a very cool funicular up to the old townsite for gelato and more exquisite views. Then we hopped the train to Poggibonsi and the bus back to San Gimignano, before heading off for our best meal of the trip. We had a lovely traditional Tuscan meal of charcuterie, pasta, Vernaccia wine and dessert on a patio overlooking the valley we walked through earlier in the day. It was a big splurge for us, but oh so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second walk, on May Day, was intended to take on a loop past the hill town of Ulignano. It started off brilliantly, descending down through a forest of poplars and pine trees, past acres of vineyards and the winery itself. But then the route branched off to a dirt trail that was described as &#39;treacherous when wet.&#39; And it sure was. The road was all mud from a big overnight rain, and the soil was heavy clay like back home, the kind that would suck off your rubber boot on the school playground. We tried our best but abandoned the trail before we hit the bottom of the valley; better that than to lose our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

This pic&#39;s for you, Ed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we tried to follow the highway to Ulignano and retake our trail on high ground, but it was too much. Too much traffic on the narrow highway was No Fun, so we retraced our steps through the forest and climbed back up to San Gimignano. I think we walked twice through the best part of the hike anyway, so it was all good. We even saw two tours of horseback riders and two crazy mountain bikers, who were descending the hill we were climbing as fast as they could. It must&#39;ve been fun, because one biker rode back up the long, steep, gravel road and screamed past us a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, in between our two hikes, we hopped on the bus and took a day trip to Siena. Yet another gorgeous Roman town with high walls, a huge cathedrals and narrow, winding streets. We don&#39;t seem to be getting tired of that yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siena was a really big deal in the 12th and 13th century, and the architecture shows that. They were competing with Florence to see who could have the best art and the most ornate cathedrals. (San Gimignano, by comparison, took the more literal approach and tried to build the most and tallest towers.) Siena did a pretty good job, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the best structure for me was the soccer stadium just outside the old town and right beside the bus station. It was lovingly nestled in a bowl in a little valley, surrounded by trees and a few bleachers. Siena plays in the lower leagues in Italy but they have a top tier stadium in my books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were planning on eating in for our last night in San Gimignano but at the last minute I made a reservation at another traditional Tuscan restaurant on a quiet side street, away from the tour groups. We had a final amazing meal in Tuscany, more meats, more pasta, and a roast rabbit with a sauce containing chocolate and wine. Delicious! A perfect end to a perfect stay in Tuscany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back, Cindy&#39;s mom said she was worried that we&#39;d find a place that was so beautiful that we would just pull up stakes and move there. Well you could do worse than Tuscany, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;d need to make new money to get there, but it sure is a worthy goal. The views, the climate, the food and the wine are simply wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the crazy thing? Today we&#39;re taking a train to Bologna. Not in Tuscany, but by all reports it&#39;s the &#39;food capital&#39; of Italy. How can it be better than this?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>La Spezia:  Gateway to Cinque Terre and So Much More</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sitting outside, in glorious sunshine, on a 50 metre long iron bench at the La Spezia Centrale station on the Ligurian coast. La Spezia is known as the Gulf of Poets, because back in the gloomy 18th century English poets like Byron, Shelley and Dickenson traveled south to get away from rainy England and swim a bit. I can see why they came. It wasn&#39;t raining much in Paris, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll ever feel the need to &amp;quot;get away&amp;quot; from Paris, but still. It sure wasn&#39;t warm and sunny and blue like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t come straight here. Instead, from Paris we went south to Nice on the French Riviera. Beautiful city and you really should go if you have the chance. But since Nice is the big city near Cannes, St. Tropez, Cap Ferrat and Monaco, it&#39;s a little glitzy and glamourous. Which is all good, but a little awkward when you&#39;ve been wearing the same clothes for six weeks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/_7PU2DPNhi-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/_7PU2DPNhi-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Nice has going for it is fabulous architecture, a narrow and twisty old town, a cool tram system that cuts silently through town, two amazing outdoor markets and outstanding gelato (go to Fennochio&#39;s in the old town.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/FZei307y-C-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/FZei307y-C-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days chilling out in Nice, walking to a market to get strawberries, oranges, fresh peas, a baguette and some cheese for lunch before wandering around the city for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long we&#39;d be down at the beach, wandering along the miles long promenade, checking out the people roasting themselves on the beach and trying to stay calm among men in tiny speedos and women sunbathing topless. Sure, the tiniest speedos were worn by old hairy grandpas, and the topless sunbathers were grannies for the most part, but we were in France, on the Riviera! Just go with it, man. Time to get over the years of body image conditioning we grow up with in North America and live like a local! Well I would&#39;ve stripped right down to my gitch for the cultural exchange, you know, if it weren&#39;t that I sunburn easily. So I took off my socks and rolled up my pant legs to just below the knee, and strolled along the water for a bit, averting my eyes all the while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/UIse9vY70i-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/UIse9vY70i-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s a marketing lesson for you all. For all the glamour you&#39;ve seen, read, or heard about the marvellous French Riviera, has it ever come up that the long, glorious beaches are all rocks? Well they are. Miles and miles of what we&#39;d call river rock back at home. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was uncomfortably sitting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RbkdAmqo8F-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RbkdAmqo8F-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here, of course, is to Accentuate The Positive. Decades of starlets and royalty sunning themselves along the Promenade des Anglais has glossed over the complete lack of sand. And hey, even now, a few days later, I&#39;ve forgotten it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/q67547Se1S-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/q67547Se1S-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last evening in Nice we decided to hike up one of the hills surrounding the bay for a better view of things. But I misread the map and instead of a 2km loop I went to a further hill, 3.5km away and much taller. We walked forever, up and up. At one point we counted a run of 285 steps when the road got too steep for cars. But the views from the top, both of the teenagers making out and the surrounding hills, coast, villas and yachts, were worth it. And we already had a wood fired pizza restaurant at the bottom of the hill picked out for dinner. Pizza, salad and a half litre of the local grape and we&#39;d forgotten all about the climb up. All that was left was the amazing view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, on to Italy. Our train to La Spezia required two changes, and we were late for both of them. But Italian trains are more relaxed on Sunday, it seems, so the trains were both waiting for us. One of my minor stresses with AirBnb apartments is keeping our host waiting for the check-in, so I was glad to get there close to our planned time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And a big highlight was sitting amongst some very, very posh folks on the train between Nice and Monte Carlo. The fellow across from me was either a Swiss banker or Benedict Cumberbatch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first impression of Italy is one of relaxed joy. First off, it&#39;s beautiful here. La Spezia is nestled in the centre of a U shaped bay, with small mountains all around. The dark green of the trees behind, the bright, azure blue of the water in front, with colourful pink, yellow and cream buildings in the middle. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the food is everything we&#39;d imagined. Simple, fresh and cheap. In France, the food is excellent, but you pay a big premium for those perfect French peas or local strawberries that are placed oh so perfectly in the baskets. Here, the markets are still full to overflowing with tomatoes, peas, strawberries and the cutest baby zucchini, but you just grab a bag and dig in. And the price is at least 30% cheaper than just around the bay in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a modern apartment on the other side of the train station from downtown. It was lovely, because we got a tiny chance to live like a local. The block around our apartment had everything we needed, really. A two person, hole in the wall, wood fired pizza place that sold so much of the local specialty, farinata (a thin omelette made of chickpea flour,) that they could hardly fit pizzas in the oven. A gelato shop that sold trays of ice cream to take home. A butcher/deli, a bakery/coffee shop, a specialty food shop, a fruit stand, a florist, a pharmacy and a Coop. We could pull together a picnic lunch, go adventuring, and come back for pizza for supper. It took us two days before we thought to look for a central market; they have one, and it&#39;s glorious too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Spezia is the gateway to the five villages of the Cinque Terre, made famous in North America by Rick Steves and his travel shows. There&#39;s stress on these former fishing villages due the crush of tourism, but that&#39;s how we heard of the Cinque Terre so I&#39;m not going to over think this. It&#39;s beautiful, we&#39;re in the area, and we&#39;ll try to tread lightly. So we hopped a train to the third village of Corniglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/rVF3QDnOzy-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/rVF3QDnOzy-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back before modern tourism hit the Cinque Terre, the villages were quite isolated. They were only accessible from the sea or via a narrow and winding trail that connected all five villages. And the villages are close enough to each other that a hiker can walk to all five villages in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-tM_NEO5G--1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/-tM_NEO5G--400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what we wanted to do, but the first two trails between Riamaggiore -- Manarola and Manarola -- Corniglia were closed due to mudslides. But that still left us half the trails to walk. Once we got up to Corniglia, that is. From the train station at sea level there was a huge set of steps up to the village. Forgoing the shuttle bus, we walked the 310 steps to the village. It&#39;s getting easier and easier to climb like this, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the cliff top and strolled into Corniglia I didn&#39;t want to leave. Ever. In a trip where we&#39;ve seen over a dozen of picturesque little towns, this was the new #1. The village square was full of little shops selling fruit, general store type supplies and postal services. Across the square were bars, coffee shops and restaurants tempting me inside. Narrow side streets house artisans selling wine, leather goods and paintings. There was even a gelato shop with a framed picture of Rick Steves himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of wandering around the village, Cindy reminded me we were there to hike, so we set off northeast toward Vernazza. It wasn&#39;t long before we started to climb, and boy did we ever climb! The path turned into steps, then the steps turned into bare rocks. I really had to focus on each step while we scrambled up and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/51ynpAxYx3-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/51ynpAxYx3-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s another thing the guidebooks don&#39;t really mention. This is a proper hike, not a gentle stroll through the countryside. While the trail is well marked with red and white blazes, it&#39;s not a groomed trail as such. The path is strewn with rocks and loose gravel and can get really narrow at points, so hikers travelling in opposite directions need to take turns on the trail. But every time I&#39;d feel like the hike was getting too hard, we&#39;d come up to a viewpoint that took my breath away. We were perched on the ridge like eagles, high above the villages, so we could see Corniglia and Manarola behind us, and Monterosso far off in the distance ahead. And if we looked down, we&#39;d see fishing boats and ferries out on the water. It was magnificent and completely worth the hard work of hiking up to these viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of hard hiking, we came across a cluster of buildings, including a small bar. Heaven! I thought we had made it to Vernazza early but a sign tempered my spirits. This was the half way point! Ah well. We savoured two amply priced glasses of cold, fresh fruit juice at a tiny black bistro table at the edge of a cliff, enjoyed the huge views and warm sunshine, then continued on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/D8q5bkuRDk-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/D8q5bkuRDk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vernazza is right down on the water, so we descended down, down, down to the village. While we were still well above the castle at the end of town, we encountered more and more hikers, but they seemed to go just high enough to get a selfie above the castle, before joining us on the trail into town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t linger too long in Vernazza. It was now 1:00, and the village square was filling up with tourists who came on the train or via bus tours. I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like here in July and August; it was crowded enough for me in mid-April. Quite the change from morning in Corniglia. We ate our picnic lunch beside the marina, climbed to the top of the castle overlooking the harbour, and found the trail to Monterosso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fHHj425Yu-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2fHHj425Yu-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Vernazza is on the water. Monterosso is also on the water. So you&#39;d think a trail between the two villages would also be along the water, right? But oh no. The trail is high, high, up on a ridgeline along the mountain that sits between the two villages. So up we climbed. Up, up, up until my heart was pounding and the afternoon sun was baking my eyebrows. It was a real lung buster, but worth it. The views were amazing once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leg of the trail is much narrower than Cornigla -- Vernazza leg, and the trail was more crowded too, so it was a stop/start hike as we paused to let southbound traffic pass. It took us two full hours to get to Monterosso, but we were lucky in a way. The descent into Monterosso is via the longest staircase I&#39;ve ever seen. It was like the steps in the Mines of Moria in the Lord of the Rings. They just went on and on. But at least they were steps! The southbound hikers had to deal with the rock ledges we climbed to get out of Vernazza. I don&#39;t think I could descend on them with the rubber legs I had now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We congratulated ourselves on our hiking prowess by soaking our feet at the beach (what a treat!) and some extra fine gelato. Then we toodled through the village for a while before catching the train back to La Spezia, tired, sore and very, very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we decided to check out La Spezia a little closer. We found a nice little coffee shop where I could get a real Italian cappuccino and, further up the block, a real Italian macchiato. We found a phone store to get an Italian SIM card for the phone, then headed to the central market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The La Spezia market is a big one. Two blocks square, with a large undulating roof over the entire complex. Everything you need is inside. Fruit stands, vegetable stands, cheese and dairy carts, butchers, florists, bakers and fishmongers. And as we&#39;ve seen everywhere else, shops and bars and restaurants surrounding the market on all four sides. It was beautiful and once we found the market we went every day, even though it was a 30 minute walk from our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love our Farmer&#39;s Market at home (heck, I took bread to the market for two years at the same time I was trying to build Orange Boot), but compared to what we see in Europe, from the largest city to the smallest town, our market in Regina sucks. I already know I&#39;m going to cry when I get home and try to shop again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, we live in the middle of nowhere, 1000km from BC fruit or 2000km from California veggies. But surely to God we can put a roof over our market so the food doesn&#39;t get soaked in the rain. And put up a wind screen while we&#39;re at it. And if I&#39;m going to dream, run enough power that the butchers can bring raw meat and keep it cool, and the cheesemongers can do the same with their dairy products. I&#39;ll set up my oven in the market too, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The La Spezia market is busy. Really busy. Busier than the number of people who live and work around it. I saw bus after bus drop off people with empty shopping bags and pick them up again, loaded up with produce for the next day (or maybe two, tops.) Nobody here asks &amp;quot;will it freeze&amp;quot;. They shop every day and eat fresh food and I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once we had our packs full of picnic fare, we got on the bus too and headed to the town of Lereci. If the Gulf of Poets is a U, and La Spezia is at the base of the U, then Lereci is at the end of the left arm. Our host Alice recommended the beach there, and after our massive hike yesterday I was in the mood for a mellow afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/3UxH0rwyS8-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/3UxH0rwyS8-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride out was a blast. We got the last two seats at the back of the bus, just before the bus was jam packed with university students. And I mean packed. They just kept getting on, handing their packs to four young ladies in the seat in front of us, then started hugging each other to save space. I&#39;ve never seen such a crush. For the longest time, nobody got off the bus, but four more people got on at each stop. More students. An old lady with bags of shopping. Some construction workers. I have no idea how they fit or where they went. But one by one, over the next 20 minutes, the bus would stop, someone would hand over a backpack from the pile, and the bus slowly thinned out. Then it was our turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lereci is beautiful. A lovely horseshoe cove with a castle at one end, a marina, and a long, curving, sandy beach that went all the way to San Terenzo, the next village on the way back to La Spezia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/it4FNrHaNd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/it4FNrHaNd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked to the top of the castle (gotta climb a little!) and gazed out across the Gulf to La Spezia in the distance, and Porto Venere at the other end of the U. It was beautiful but also very windy. I wanted to sketch and paint up there but I couldn&#39;t control my sketchbook in the wind, so we retreated down to the marina and checked out the shops lining the quay. Then we went for a sit at the beach and I tried not to compare the bronze sunbathers to the rotisserie chicken I saw at the market in La Spezia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Lereci has the best gelato I&#39;ve had so far. The local flavour, called Lereci, of course, ticks all the boxes. Coffee, nuts, caramel, chocolate all swirled around in some basic crema gelato. Amazing. Until this point my favourite was pistachio (made with real pistachios of course) but now I&#39;m ruined. Hopefully some other local flavour will win my heart down the road, but I&#39;m not holding out much hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in La Spezia, we took the bus to the other end of the U, to Porto Venere. Another spectacular fishing village with a lovely marina, two churches and even a castle on the hill. Porto Venere is really tucked in there tight between the water and the cliffs, so that getting past the first row of houses required some serious climbing. But there were spectacular views around every corner, so we kept on climbing and being wowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was getting on in the afternoon, but we weren&#39;t ready to leave the Cinque Terre yet. Cindy had read about a big hike from Porto Venere to the first Cinque Terre village, Riamaggiore. 12km, 4 hours and listed as &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; difficulty. The same book said the hikes we did two days ago were &amp;quot;easy-moderate.&amp;quot; Hmmm. Well it was a nice day, we felt good and it was at least 5 hours till sunset, so we decided to go for it. We&#39;d abandon our return bus tickets, do the hike and catch the train back to town from Riomaggiore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/37CsLogg0m-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/37CsLogg0m-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it was the best hike I&#39;ve ever done. Way harder than I imagined; we climbed 500m pretty much straight up, then followed the ridge line around two separate mountains, before descending through vineyards and farms to the village at Riomaggiore. As we twisted up the mountains, through forests, then out on bare rock ledges, then back into forests, we had these wild views of Porto Venere, then La Spezia and Lereci across the Gulf to our right, then the wider Mediterranean off our left shoulder, then finally Riamaggiore below us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we entered Riamaggiore we were sore, tired and grimy. But the tour buses were long gone, the village was beautiful and we saw the most amazing sunset from a brick lane above Riamaggiore&#39;s tiny harbour. It was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t imagine ever finding a place more beautiful than this. But I&#39;ve said that every day so far on this trip and I&#39;ve been wrong each time. I can&#39;t wait to see what we find next.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Quick Update: I&#39;m Having Too Much Fun To Write!</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/quick-update-i-m-having-too-much-fun-to-write/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi. I&#39;m writing this from the smallest studio apartment I&#39;ve ever stayed in. We figure it&#39;s 200 square feet, including the bathroom. Smaller than most people&#39;s bedrooms, I bet. But it&#39;s in the Montparnasse neighbourhood in Paris and we&#39;ve never been happier. The power was out for 14 hours last night (just in our apartment). Didn&#39;t care. We just went out and when we got back, lit some candles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last long story I wrote was about our week in Madrid. I&#39;ll get back to those longer stories, but here&#39;s a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the train to Barcelona, which is the coolest city every. My favourite on the trip so far. We went out for tapas with our new friends Gillian and Brian (Gillian is the daughter of our friend Laverne) and had a great time. Then Cindy and I walked all over the place, from the Park Gaudi, through the Gracia neighbourhood and to the beach. Then we did it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re done going to cathedrals because we&#39;ve been to the best. The Sagrada Familia is still under construction (started in 1882, should be done in 10 years or so) but is so amazing, so spectacular that I&#39;m still overwhelmed by the beauty of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bummer: on our last night in Barcelona, I walked into a coffee bar to watch the last 10 minutes of El Clasico on TV. Put my pack down to pay for coffee, took a sip, and my pack was gone. My passport was in the pack. That made things more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going to the police department and filing a report, we continued as normal, taking the train into France. First destination was Arles, in Provence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arles was cold and rainy, but we had a large, warm, rustic apartment that was incredibly romantic. We hung out for a few days and took a vacation from our vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arles is a neat city because they have a Roman Arena that is still being used for bullfights, and a Roman Theatre that is being restored too. (They backed Julius Caesar.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arles, we realized this passport problem was going to throw a wrench into things. I thought we could get a new one at the consulate in Nice, but I had to go to the embassy in Paris instead. Ugh. So we pulled out the map and started tweaking our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending the morning at the huge weekly market in Arles, we took the train to Avignon, 35km up the road. And the sun came out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another great AirBnb apartment in Avignon. It was a great home base to get some laundry done and eat several roast chicken meals from the deli across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Avignon and Arles are on the banks of the Rhone River. One day in Avignon we walked across the bridge to an island in the middle of the Rhone, then rented bikes and rode the 16km around the island. We went through villages, farms, and acres and acres of orchards. The peach trees were blooming too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered around the town for a couple of days then took a bus ride out to Pont du Gard, an amazing triple decker Roman Aqueduct. The best aqueduct so far, and we&#39;ve seen a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we took the TGV train to Paris. Aw shucks. There&#39;s worse places to be stuck without a passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re in love with Paris! Cindy is getting weepy she&#39;s smiling so much. The architecture. The parks. The amazing shops and bakeries and cafes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s without a doubt the most expensive city we&#39;ve ever seen, a real budget bomber, but we&#39;re eating well and zipping about on the metro. I think we&#39;ll splurge at one of the cafes tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/QBFbvUEJh9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/QBFbvUEJh9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick note. Before we left we watched this great show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/what-phils-having/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;ll have what Phil&#39;s having&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on PBS. Awesome show. Romantic, interesting and compelling travel show. But it should be called &amp;quot;I can&#39;t afford what Phil&#39;s having&amp;quot;! We went to all his haunts in Paris but one (still need to find the falafel stand) and it&#39;s crazy what things cost. His favourite roast chicken will set you back $150. Vegetables, drinks, and likely plates and forks are extra. Jeez. But we&#39;re finding great food our own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2fPznQEBPf-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2fPznQEBPf-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passport issue is fixed (if you pay enough fees and penalties, things get done fast, and my friends Curt and Bob helped from back home) so we&#39;re heading back south on Thursday. Spring has sprung here, but it&#39;s still pretty chilly at night. Time for some Riviera sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fyK1jaLkbW-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fyK1jaLkbW-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;re all caught up. We&#39;re having so much fun and seeing so many amazing things that when we get back to the apartment we just fall into a heap. And it turns out I get motion sick on trains when I try to read or type (I thought I&#39;d write on the train.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got a few emails where people were worried, so I had to get a quick dispatch out. We&#39;re good. Really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After one more trip around our favourite street in Córdoba, which was deserted after all the Holy Wednesday festivities, we hiked back to the station for our train to Madrid. We had booked on the bullet-nosed high speed train and I was a little excited for the trip. After all the bus rides we were finally travelling the &#39;European Way&#39;. And a fast train, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun ride. We were quickly up to a top speed of 270 km/h for our two hour ride to Madrid. It didn&#39;t feel much faster than normal highway driving, except when I tried to see something outside or, heaven forbid, snap a picture. Then you realized we were passing things at a very great speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plains in Spain are quite beautiful. I remember hearing somewhere they get lots of precipitation and it shows. Lots of trees dotting green pastures, with sheep and goats and later, cows. Quite honestly, it was a lot like the plains at home, except for the rocky outcroppings that dotted the landscape. And then the train slowed, we rolled past industrial areas, then apartment blocks, then we were in Madrid. We went from the train to the metro, got off at the Bilbao station and found our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, all these cities are old and romantic and beautiful. But like all cities it seems, they continue to grow, and there isn&#39;t the investment in aesthetics anymore. We passed mile after mile of the same ugly, tiny windowed, balcony-less brick apartment blocks on the way into Madrid and they looked like a sad and dreary place to live. Compared to the centre of Madrid, it was shockingly horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As late as the 1920&#39;s, Madrid was still doing strong city planning, as witnessed in the glorious Grand Via. But that seems to have stopped in current times, outside of the centre of the city. Which is a shame. And totally consistent with home, although it doesn&#39;t feel like we do much planning in the centre at home either. But the centre of Madrid is glorious, so let&#39;s go back there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pension for the next five nights was the Pension Antonio, on Calle de la Palma. It was tiny and spare but quiet and clean and centrally located, between the Royal Palace to the east and the Prado Museum to the west, with lots of bars and restaurants and stores in between. It was just fine and cheap enough to recommend to others, although be warned that the last two blocks to the apartment feel pretty sketchy to walk down. But that&#39;s just the prairie boy in me reacting to the corrugated steel grates in front of the closed shops and the excessive, monotonous, ugly graffiti. I like Banksy and all, and some businesses pre-empted things by hiring an artist to spray paint their doors in advance, but holy crap it&#39;s just endless here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest thing that hit me about Madrid is that we were in a really big city. Really big. I looked it up and Madrid&#39;s population is 3.5 million people, which makes the largest city we&#39;ve been to by far. You could tell the difference. No narrow, winding streets here. Instead we had long, grand boulevards, with six lanes of cars and huge fountains and statues in the roundabouts. And masses, and masses of people. Even when we were out looking for something to eat at 9PM, the sidewalks were packed with people doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were in Madrid for Easter Weekend, which meant that some of the stores were open irregular hours, but most all of the bars and restaurants were open. And boy oh boy are there ever a lot of bars and restaurants! I&#39;ve never seen so many places packed that tightly before. Every single street was packed with places big and small. We found a really good sandwich shop on Calle Pez and a gourmet pizza place nearer Bilbao station and lots of bakeries and fruit stands to keep our backpacks stocked up. But there were more than enough people to keep them all going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long weekend and fine weather meant everyone was out enjoying their time off, so we loaded up our backpacks and joined the fray. We walked west toward the Plaza d&#39;Espana, with its huge foutain at one end and massive statue at the other. It&#39;s a very impressive square, surrounded by regal offices and fancy hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal circuit has one walking left to the Royal Palace, but we went right to walk through a fine little park. We were surprised to see a stone temple on a hill in the middle of the park so went up to take a closer look. I assumed it was a Roman temple, but when we walked inside there were Egyptian hieroglyphs on the wall. What? We went looking for a pamphlet to figure out what we were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Temple of Debod is a real Egyptian temple, but in Madrid. When the Egyptians built the Aswan Dam in the 1960&#39;s, many ancient temples and tombs were submerged. This temple was dismantled and moved to Madrid instead. Very interesting, but a little out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the temple was a gondola that gave rides to a large nature reserve right near the heart of the city. The line wasn&#39;t too long this holiday morning so we took a ride over. The views back to the city centre were amazing and the park itself was very nice. Lots of bikers and joggers running up the hill that we rode to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we went to the Royal Palace, along with twenty thousand other people. The palace was quite nice but it was a real crush of people, so we hung back a bit and wandered through two statue filled parks that surrounded the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept up the park theme the next day, Good Friday. We hiked east from our room, behind the Prado Museum and the National Library to Paque de El Retiro. This huge space is where thousands upon thousands of Madrilenos go on their days off and this war, sunny spring day was no exception. We started at the formal north end of the park, with formal gardens and a large man-made lake. There were dozens of rowboats on the lake and a very long line of people waiting to rent one. We walked around to the east side and watched the boats from a large plaza, complete with lion statues looking over the boaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we strolled past two smaller palacios and another formal garden which contained Madrid&#39;s oldest tree (planted in the 1650&#39;s.) But I was mesmerized by the &amp;quot;cabin for the association of retired men&amp;quot;, a rustic wooden lodge with a few dozen old fellows playing chess on the patio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south side of the park was more informal, with lots of benches and grassy slopes just begging to be lied down on. So we did, after eating our picnic lunch. We deserved a rest; we&#39;d been walking a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we love toodling through parks, Madrid is home to some excellent museums and it didn&#39;t seem right to ignore them. The Prado Museum has free entry from 6PM - 8PM so at around 5:30 we went looking for the entrance. There was already around 100 people in line, but it looked manageable, so we queued up. We were at the side door, and it wasn&#39;t long before our line bumped into an even longer line for the main door. There must&#39;ve been 2000 people in all, at least. It was huge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, the Prado is even huger, and we all fit in with no problem and, aside from the &#39;big 3&#39; paintings, there wasn&#39;t even a crowd. Sorry, no pictures were allowed, but it really was a fun time. We had a New York Times article outlining the preferred order to see the museum&#39;s highlights, which we followed and really felt like experts. My favourite paintings were by the Dutch Masters - we went through that gallery twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big gallery, the Reina Sofia, is focused on Cubist and Surrealist paintings by the likes of Picasso, Dali and Joan Miro. But I was there for one painting: Picasso&#39;s masterpiece &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot;. It&#39;s fair to say that &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot; is the reason I wanted to go to Madrid. It&#39;s a massive painting, a protest painting for the bombing of women and children during the Spanish Civil War and I am so very happy I got to see it live and in person. It was even better than I thought it would be. (Although, I was very surprised that I didn&#39;t enjoy the Dalis more.)&lt;/p&gt;

Photos aren&#39;t allowed in the gallery!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m embarrassed to say I don&#39;t know much about the Spanish Civil War, other than Franco won, the Germans tested their arms in Spain prior to invading Poland, and Hemingway was there. The &amp;quot;Guernica&amp;quot; gallery helped me learn a bit more about it. The painting was commissioned by the Republican (in power, but lost the war) government for the 1939 World Expo, to help raise awareness of what was happening in Spain, and hopefully get some assistance. In the gallery, there was a replica of the pavilion where the painting was first shown, along with posters of the time and other reflections on the costs of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a very interesting display showing Picasso&#39;s progression as he worked on the painting. His partner at the time was a photographer and she took a series of shots of this massive mural during its development. There was also a room full of &#39;post script&#39; paintings where Picasso continued to develop the themes within the painting. Fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between parks, art galleries, the classic Atocha train station and strolling down wide boulevards admiring the architecture, we had a wonderful few days in Madrid. We found a tiny square near our room which we adopted as &#39;our square&#39;, since it had the perfect combination of restaurants, ice cream, coffee, newsstands and bookshops. It even had an art supply store! So it seemed like we ended up at our square at least once per day, at least to end our day with coffee and hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter Sunday was a big thrill for me. Before we left Cindy told me about the Sunday stamp market in Plaza Mayor so even though it was Easter we decided to see if it was on. And boy was it ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaza Mayor is the classic town square of Madrid. It&#39;s completely enclosed by four connected banks of buildings but the open square inside is huge and holds thousands of people. Usually the square is full of tables from the surrounding restaurants, and they were still there. But on Sunday&#39;s there are also 50 or so tables full of stamp, coin, postcard and bottle cap dealers out selling their wares. And since it was Easter Sunday, there were also a few thousand people in the middle of the square watching the final Easter procession of the season. All drummers putting on a show. So the square was loud and boisterous and I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent an hour wandering around the tables, regretting I didn&#39;t collect Spanish stamps. And regretting my suitcase wasn&#39;t big enough to start collecting Spanish stamps! But I bought a set as a souvenir that would fit inside my notebook for protection and left it at that. Big fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Madrid we walked down to the train station for a day trip to Toledo. After four days in this massive, crowded city we needed some space. Toledo is a beautiful old walled city, perched high on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding valley, just 70km from Madrid. We were there in 30 minutes by train and had a wonderful afternoon climbing the hill and once again wandering through narrow, twisting streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing I&#39;ll remember most is the nature trail we found that went around the base of the city along the river that passes Toledo. We spent an hour or so walking along the river, watching the fishermen and the couples necking on benches, with sheer rock walls across the water to our right and the walled city above us to our left. And then, because we had time, we hiked back up to the city, up the incredibly steep stone staircase that passed through the walls, for some gelato before walking back down and across the river to the train station.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Córdoba:  Processions, Patios and Pails of Snails</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/cordoba-processions-patios-and-pails-of-snails/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had tickets on our traditional noon bus northwest to Córdoba, but first we had to get out of Granada. On our walk yesterday, we walked west, away from downtown, and away from the tourist area, into a regular neighbourhood. There we found a delightful neighbourhood pastelaria, with great coffee, a bin full of oranges for juice and pan integral (whole wheat bread) for toast. Now all we had to do is find it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is a double edged sword. That little black box in my pocket, playfully named Big Black Olaf, is crucial for finding our way around the narrow, twisting streets of medieval European cities. Paper maps just don&#39;t cut it; the streets are smaller than the names, making them impossible to label properly. But Big Black Olaf, along with the maps.me app, can get me anywhere, and can get me back there again. But only if I pin the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s where the trouble began. We had such a delightful time yesterday, but I forgot to pin the location on the map. So this morning, all we knew is that it was &amp;quot;west&amp;quot; and about a kilometre from our apartment. Past that big fountain with the plaza running &amp;quot;south&amp;quot;, but before the large park with the running track and old men playing bocce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But was it before, or after, the university residences with raised gardens full of rosemary and walls full of political graffiti? What about the roundabout with tapas bars we were at last night? Surely it&#39;s not that far away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we walked, and walked, and squabbled a little. When we tried to piece together our walk from the day before, we came up with two completely different orders. And I&#39;ll admit to you, like I admitted to Cindy on the day, that I&#39;m not at my best without my morning coffee. So I caused a scene and we had a spat and then we looked up and there it was, across the street. Argh. I got my coffee and Cindy got her juice and we bought make up toast and four make up sandwiches for the bus ride and then quietly walked back to the room to get our bags and get on the bus for the bus depot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride to Córdoba was smooth and pleasant, helped along by the sandwiches and Spanish Gravol. Outside, the landscape was beautiful. As we came out of the mountains, the miles and miles and miles of olive orchards gave way to gently rolling hills and wheat fields. Wheat fields! It was a sunny day and the wheat was already well along, creating a bright green carpet that popped against the bright blue afternoon sky. Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maps.me was in a good mood today, and picked a walking route to our guest room that passed through two parks. No major freeways for us! So we had a delightful walk to our room and for the first time, arrived feeling upbeat about our surroundings. (So far, our locations needed a day to grow on us.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest room for the next three nights was in Manuela&#39;s house and it was a real treat. We had a huge, elaborately decorated room and a very large tiled bathroom with double sinks even. There were so many statuettes and icons around the room, so many armoires and dressers and side tables, so many tablecloths and doilies and other fabrics that we put our towel underneath our suitcases lest we get anything dirty. Perhaps the decor was better suited to an older couple, but we had a ton of space and Manuela was very nice. I think our Spanish was improving because our charades went more easily as we learned about all the keys and locks and how the doors work. We could even share pictures of the snowstorm back home and agreed things were better in Córdoba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room was about 1km outside of the main tourist area and that&#39;s a very good thing. We kept discovering tiny fruit shops and cafes and gelaterias down side alleys that didn&#39;t even have signs out front. You couldn&#39;t tell they were there until you walked down the alley, so of course we walked down all the alleys and made sure we found them all. But wow was it tight. I measured our street, and wall to wall, including two &#39;sidewalks&#39; and the road, was eleven feet wide. When a car came down the road we hugged the wall and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we felt claustrophobic, we&#39;d walk two blocks to a small thoroughfare with wider sidewalks and more shops. This was our breakfast street every day. Friendly people, big glasses of orange juice, tiny glasses of strong coffee and tostadas. I discovered the local custom of spreading puréed tomatoes on my toast instead of jam and it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/h1CF_TmAnT-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/h1CF_TmAnT-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down this street is the main square. Bars and restaurants ring the outside with City Hall in the middle. Then we turned the corner around City Hall and found Roman pillars! There were the remains of a Roman temple right beside City Hall! Amazing. While not as complete as the temple in Evora, it was still quite spectacular and a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/kfJ0UQ8aiL-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the main square was blocked off for Easter processions, so we turned left and headed down to the Mesquita. It&#39;s a Mosque/Cathedral that is the centrepiece of tourism in Córdoba, but for now we just walked around it, through the winding alleys of the Jewish quarter and headed to the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Córdoba is situated alongside the Guadalquivir River, which makes it a very strategic city, ever since Roman times. The Romans built a beautiful bridge across the river right near where the Mesquita now stands and as it was gorgeous evening, we strolled along the bridge for almost an hour, watching the ducks in the river, looking at the remains of windmills from Roman times, taking photos in the amazing evening light and watching the thousands of fellow tourists doing exactly the same thing. It was the start of Easter Break, so we saw our first busloads of high school and university students on a tour of Spain. It added to the overall energy level in the place, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is still city on the other side of the bridge, there isn&#39;t a whole bunch, so I could still see the rolling hills and green wheat fields in the distance, which warmed my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued our stroll along the river then headed back to our neighbourhood to find a place for supper. Just like in Granada, we stumbled across a crowd in front of one of the cathedrals, filling the whole plaza / intersection. Easter procession! So we hung out for a while, tried to chat with our neighbours, watched the children having fun and watched the police try to re-route traffic, including a massive tour bus that clearly made a wrong turn at some point. And then, just like Granada, the crowd dispersed before anything happened. Procession&#39;s suspended, someone said. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we took care of business. It was laundry day, so I googled the nearest laundromat and we headed away from downtown, 1km across the train tracks. It&#39;s another one of those big differences from Regina. At home, walking to a public laundromat, 1km across the tracks, is a scary bit of business. Sea Spray laundry at home isn&#39;t a lot of fun and certainly not a place I&#39;d want to hang out. But boy were we ever surprised in Córdoba!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we had to cross the tracks. But we couldn&#39;t find the tracks! Rather than the ugliness that splits downtown Regina and the Warehouse District, here they built a hill over the tracks, so the trains ran underground from the station to the outskirts of town. And on top of the hill, they built parks! And planted trees, and installed sculptures and fountains! It was gorgeous and something we totally need to do at home. I&#39;m forwarding pictures to my city councillor and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&#39;t want to insult Sea Spray Laundry, but this laundromat was gorgeous. Spotless. Self Service. With automatic soap and softener dispensing so we didn&#39;t even need to buy soap. So we loaded up, set a timer on the phone and went for a walk around the neighbourhood. It was so pretty. Just your friendly neighbourhood shopping district, with butcher shops and fruit shops and fish shops and pharmacies and banks and anything else you&#39;d need. Friends meeting on the corner to say hi. Children out for a walk with their grandparents. We wandered around with our mouths open, staring at how awesome it all was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our imagined need for private, detached houses with big yards at home means there just aren&#39;t enough people to support this level of commerce in a neighbourhood. At least that&#39;s what the real estate folks keep telling us. But these blocks of four story buildings with apartments and offices above stores on the ground floor sure look good to me. And everyone seemed happy enough. And Manuela&#39;s apartment is huge too. Massive even. Bigger than I need, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh yeah, I forgot to mention. Córdoba is full of courtyards and inner patios! One of the reasons the streets are so narrow is to maximize courtyard space. We walked by some beauties. They have an annual &#39;patio walk&#39; in Córdoba, similar to our &#39;Secret Garden Tour&#39; at home. I&#39;d love to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, on our way to supper, we came across another procession right near our room. And there were purple hats too! This one actually happened and it was quite a bit of fun. The crowd was smaller than in Granada, but still big enough to make us find an alternate route to supper. We&#39;d learn to call this a small crowd before the week was out. But as we drank wine and ate tapas, we watched the TV and got a hint of the fervour these processions cause all over Andalucia. The TV had pictures from Seville, Malaga, Cadiz, Huelva, Granada and Córdoba, showing crowds and processions getting underway all across the region. Then it cut to the sad news from Brussels, about which I&#39;ve already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it was time for our tour of the Mesquita. You can get in for free between 8:30AM and 10:30AM, so that&#39;s exactly what we did. Along with 500 other people who got there earlier than we did. No matter though, the Mesquita is massive. 5000 people could be in there and it wouldn&#39;t feel crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has an interesting history. First there was a Romman temple on the site. After the Romans retreated, the Visigoths built a Christian temple on the site. When the Moors conquered Spain, the site was split and Christians and Muslims worshiped side by side. Then in the 8th century, the Sultan in power bought the Christian half and built the largest Mosque in Western Europe on the site. Then, with the Christian re-conquest in the 13th century, a huge cathedral was built inside the Mosque. That is to say, the entire building is a cathedral, but the Christian bits have been added to the Muslim bits. So the whole structure looks rather odd. Muslim architecture but Christian icons, with a Gothic cathedral in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s odd and overwhelmingly spectacular at the same time. We spent two hours looking up and taking pictures that in no way portray the grandeur of the place. Because it&#39;s an active Cathedral and not a museum, there&#39;s very little mention of the Muslim antecedents of the building. However there is a section at the back that has been left in it&#39;s original Moorish state. Plus there is a display of some remains of the Visigoth temple in one corner too. It&#39;s a shame, really, because there is so much layered history here that an interpretive pamphlet would really make the history come alive. There are private tour groups that do this; might be worth your while when you visit. Or read up ahead. Or just enjoy the majesty of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were getting tapas&#39;d out. The effort to interpreting Spanish menus and coming to decisions on what was or was not octopus was tiring us out. And that time I went to what I thought was a coffee shop on the plaza but learned they sold pails of snails really freaked me out. So for supper on our last night in Córdoba we decided in advance to head to the Jewish Quarter beside the Mesquita and find an Arabian place with couscous and chicken tajin. It was Wednesday night and we thought we&#39;d be relatively safe from Easter procession crowds. Boy were we wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to Mesquita from our place is to go down our little &#39;main street&#39;, through the town square, then turn left and head down to the river. But our main street was packed; we could see Mary heading off down the road towards a church. There was no way that would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we took a left and tried to get ahead of the parade. If we could get ahead of the first purple hoods, it was polite to cross the road. So we leaped ahead of Mary&#39;s procession and got to the town square, but that was even more jammed. Jesus had already made it to the town square. So we went further left, parallel to the parade route, until we reached the river, then backtracked and got to the Jewish Quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started looking for a restaurant with couscous and tajin (by that point I was actually craving couscous) but soon realized we were deep into the tourist zone. Too many English menus. Too many burgers. Too many cocktails. And the crowds kept growing and growing. Finally, after an hour of looking, we found a place with couscous on the menu and a table for two just inside the door. We ducked in and tried to ignore all the English being spoken around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon we couldn&#39;t hear the English for all the drumming. Another procession was passing right beside the restaurant! Right by our table, in fact. I pushed outside and grabbed a few pictures between courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/dt2KqKfXj0-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/dt2KqKfXj0-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &amp;quot;TGI-Couscous&amp;quot; this place wasn&#39;t too bad. We paid and plotted our course for home. There was still a huge crowd at the restaurant. Too big to cross. But the Mesquita was behind us. If we went the long way round the Mesquita maybe we could find open road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/tThSNpvU-E-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/tThSNpvU-E-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we headed out along the south side of the Mesquita and after a while turned right, into a huge crowd of spectators, hooded processioners and a full band. Another procession! They hadn&#39;t really started, so we crossed the street and tried to pass along the crowd on the left. That didn&#39;t really work, so after a block we ducked down a side street and tried walking parallel to the procession again. We got stuck 1/2 a block from the intersection. Just solid people, and too far away to see the procession anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I muttered to Cindy, &amp;quot;the Christians are pushing us back to the river!&amp;quot;, which was happening, albeit unintentionally. But that gave us an idea. We headed to the river, away from our room, then walked along it until we were at least eight blocks past the Mesquita, the town square and even our little &amp;quot;main street.&amp;quot; Then north, then back and safely home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, we saw four different Mary floats and at least three Jesus floats, eight bands and five different colours of hoods. It was quite a night. But my favourite thing of all was the little kids collecting wax balls, drip by drip, from the candles carried by the hooded folk. And the hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people, from the very young, to the very old, eating sunflower seeds along the parade route. And by morning, how it was all swept up so there was no way of knowing the processions even happened. But they did. And it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Granada:  Hints of Arabia in Andalucia</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/granada-hints-of-arabia-in-andalucia/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We left Seville with a touch of sadness, a feeling that will no doubt be a part of many departures on this trip. It was off to the bus station for a 3-4 hour trip east and south to Granada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granada is one of the three jewels of Andalucia (the others being Seville and Cordoba) and is the most remote. Well, remote isn&#39;t really accurate, since Granada is a major city and tourist destination, but it is the last major destination still to be served by high speed trains. We passed the new track, still under construction, several times on the trip. But for now it was buses and that was fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/HT9f846MxP-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/HT9f846MxP-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape along the trip was dramatic once again. Gone were the orange orchards of Portugal and western Spain. Now it was miles and miles of olive trees, stretching as far as we could see in all directions, through rolling hills and gently twisting roads. Every once in a while, we&#39;d see an especially tall hill. In those cases, there was always a cluster of white walled houses up the side of the hill and a castle and walls on top. I scanned the distant hills for knights on horseback but could never pick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/G1JIh7rSds-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/G1JIh7rSds-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to Granada we started to climb. Bare rocky outcrops thrust out of the ground. First a single mountain, then a group, and then we were fully in the mountains. Granada lies in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains and as we pulled into the city we could see snow covered peaks off in the distance. I learned that there&#39;s quite a nice ski resort off in those mountains, even though it was 15c in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our room for the next three nights was the barest of the trip so far. It was basically a spare bedroom and access to the bathroom, in the house of Rafa and David, two young artists. They were very nice, the room was warm and the bed comfortable, and the location, right beside the main cathedral, was excellent. Even though we didn&#39;t really see them very much, we didn&#39;t feel comfortable hanging out in their house. So we were out on the street from morning till bedtime most days. When we came back to our room to dry off and warm up, we were often visited by their skinny black cat, who quite enjoyed my backpack for some reason. I have claw marks as a souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granada is a very interesting city in that it was the last stronghold of Moorish (Muslim) rule in Spain. When the Christian crusaders invaded the Iberian peninsula around 1200AD, they came from the north and conquered cities like Seville and Córdoba, but took much longer to get south and east to Granada. In fact, it seems like there was acceptance of joint rule of the area for a time. When we were in Seville, I read of a palace in the centre of the city where the ruler hired artisans from all over Spain to work on the building, including Muslim artisans from Granada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of Muslim/Arabic culture is throughout the city but is especially strong in the Arabic quarter, a ghetto of narrow, hilly, twisting streets close to the main avenues. The area is full of tea rooms, hookah lounges and stores selling gorgeous glass lamps, leather goods and silver tea sets. We went to eat in this area twice during our stay, grateful for the delicious vegetable couscous and clay bowls with chicken tajin. But our big discovery was the array of delicious tea in these restaurants. Sweet, creamy concoctions with all kinds of spices. Our favourite was called &#39;sol y nieve&#39;, a strawberry and cinnamon tea with a mountain of whipped cream on top. It was an excellent after dinner selection that I fully intend to make at home somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the Arabic quarter we strolled along the river, along cobblestone plazas full of restaurants and bars. Then we turned left and began to climb up a very steep hillside until we came to a lookout with great views of the city, the main cathedral (right by our room) and the fields and mountains beyond. And a spectacular view of the jewel of Granada, the Alhambra. This amazing palace, castle and garden sits high on the hill on the other side of the river, looming proudly over the city below. It was the last stronghold of Muslim rule in Europe and we were going to tour it tomorrow. But for now, we just looked across the valley and admired the grand structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the Alhambra is a major attraction, the authorities control how many people get in each day. They accept 6000 visitors per day and you can buy either a morning ticket or an afternoon ticket. And each ticket has a specific time where you can visit the Nazrid Palace, the high point of the trip. So on the bus ride into town, we bought &#39;morning&#39; tickets for the next day, with a 1:30PM entry into the Nazrid Palace. We didn&#39;t know it at the time, but we were very lucky. All tickets for the entire weekend we were in Granada were sold out by the time we went to the tourist office to pick up our tickets, three hours after we booked them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we grabbed an early breakfast and hiked up to the entrance of the Alhambra, trying to get a jump on the tour busses. It was a steep hike, but thanks to a tip from the lady at the ticket office yesterday, we did all our climbing at the start. We begin the tour at the Generalife Garden at the high point of the grounds, and strolled pretty much downhill from there. The massive formal garden was built as a place for the sultans to relax when life in the palace got too hectic. So long as we paced ourselves well between the Italian tour and the Japanese tour, we could get a sense of the tranquil nature of the place. I also got a thrill looking at the vegetable gardens that were neatly laid out on terraces below the formal garden. After days of orange-red or white soil, it was nice to see some deeper colour in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the gardens it was a nice stroll through a tiny village within the walls. There were some restaurants and souvenir shops but also a small shop where two men made very elegant and ornate boxes, platters, chess sets and backgammon boards. The were all intricately inlaid with different types of wood and then heavily lacquered. They were gorgeous and priced to reflect the hours of work that went into each piece. Beautiful but outside my budget, alas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked past a small, nondescript building then backtracked to read the small sign and finally went in. I&#39;m glad we did, since the building was the remains of a hammam, or Muslim bathhouse. It was a cluster of small rooms with curved doorways and with start shaped holes cut through the roof to let the light in. Deep, dark and mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were into our first example of the layering of history. When the Christians finally defeated the Moors in Granada, they took over the Alhambra complex and started converting it to a Christian palace. The first addition was a large cathedral in the middle of the site. Later it was followed by a massive palace, built for King Carlos V, in the middle of the main square. Our guidebook mentioned that the palace has divided opinion over the years. It&#39;s either an excellent example of 18th century architecture or an abomination in the middle of the Moorish aesthetic. Well, it doesn&#39;t look like anything else around it, that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a pattern evolving here that is interesting and a little sad. It&#39;s one of conquest and re-conquest all over this part of Europe, but is really apparent with structures like the Alhambra. Romans - Goths - Moors - Christians, and in the case of the Christian re-conquest, a need to rework the architecture to get rid of, or at least downplay, the Moorish influence. And then there&#39;s Napoleon. When the French invaded Spain they used the Alhambra as a barracks and nearly blew it up in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes up again and again in this region. When the Moors are conquered their architecture is changed, then Napoleon comes and nearly wrecks everything. Then, thankfully, someone recognizes the historical (and touristical) importance of these treasures and they are restored and a ticket office put in front. And I don&#39;t mind the ticket offices one bit because these are beautiful, beautiful places and deserve to be restored and celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the Alhambra, it was the American Washington Irving who is credited for opening people&#39;s eyes to the amazing Alhambra. He lived in Granada for a while after Napoleon left and the Alhambra was falling into disrepair. His writing about the place inspired the restoration work. Hopefully this writing inspires you to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tour before our time in the palace was the Alcazaba. This castle / walled area was the oldest part of the complex and afforded more incredible views of the city as well as the lookout we sat on last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lhE5PPbIHN-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/lhE5PPbIHN-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stood in line we met a foursome from Ontario who were travelling through Spain in the reverse order we were, but they were driving the whole way. I was amazed and a little dumbfounded, especially as they told me about taking wrong turns through the centre of Seville. Why anyone would choose to drive through these places when you could walk or take the transit is beyond me. They also told me they booked their tickets to Alhambra over a month ago, so I guess we were lucky to get ours the day before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was our time to visit the Nazrid Palace. What a stunner. It was more elaborate and ornate than I imagined, but subdued too. When I think of a palace I think of precious metals or gems (I&#39;ve not seen many palaces, but that&#39;s what I think!) but the Nazrid is amazing for different reasons. It&#39;s more about the artisans that built it. Every square inch of some walls are covered in ornate plaster carvings and Arabic script. Some ceilings have even more elaborate plaster domes, giving the impression of a starry night. Other halls had domed ceilings of stretched leather, which was then painted into elaborate patterns. The palace tour was an incredible climax to an already amazing tour of the grounds. It&#39;s well worth the trip to Granada to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last full day in Granada was Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week or Semana Santa in Spain. The entire week is a huge holiday in Spain, a combination of mourning and partying at the same time. The week starts off with a big procession, mourning the death of Jesus and Mary&#39;s sorrow. We had heard about these processions and were very excited to see one in person. Although, truth be told, it was a bit of a mystery as to where and when the procession would happen. Many of the central squares had been blocked off and large sets of bleachers installed, but as the day went on an we walked around the city, we never saw anyone sitting in the bleachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at around 4pm, we saw more and more people heading off in the same direction, away from the bleachers, so we followed along. Soon we came to a different cathedral, with hundreds of people packed tight around the cathedral doors and sort of making a path down the block. I say &#39;sort of&#39; because there&#39;s no such thing as an orderly line in Spain. But it seemed possible that we had made it to the procession route. Laughable attempts to communicate with the man standing next to me confirmed that the procession would start at the cathedral in about an hour. We had stumbled on front row seats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stood there, more and more people squeezed past us, even though I was sure there was no way more people could fit in this square. Our colourful Canadian outerwear must&#39;ve screamed &amp;quot;This Way Through&amp;quot; because everyone seemed to pass beside or between us, even if we linked arms. A gaggle of teenage girls. Teenage boys with the most incredible Justin Beiber pompadours. Mothers with strollers. Old men with walkers. I&#39;m not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it started to rain. Out came 1000 umbrellas, or in our case, up went hoods. We would&#39;ve stayed dry except that, without umbrellas, we were in the drip line of all our neighbours. Then slowly people started leaving. The procession was suspended, for how long nobody new, due to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were disappointed, but also wet and cold so we went back to our room to change clothes and warm up. We were just about to head out for supper when we heard drums and horns and followed the music to the main cathedral. There it was! The procession! We hurried over and found a place to stand behind a pair of strollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the procession is supposed to be for mourning, the entire event is quite the celebration. Everyone is dressed up, especially the little children. Vendors with carts selling drinks, candy, snacks (especially sunflower seeds - everyone was eating them, from the schoolchildren to young women to the elderly), balloons and toy drums lined each street. There was a huge amount of anticipation as we waited for the procession to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really was quite a production. First, several dozen marchers disguised in robes and pointed hoods, carrying candles. Then a huge &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; of Jesus, carried by 20-25 young men, hidden underneath. The float was so heavy that every few minutes they&#39;d have to set it down and have a rest, or trade with other men who followed the float.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Nkt7C1CvtB-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you see the people holding up the float, behind the screen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the float were ladies of all ages in black mourning dresses and veils, followed by a marching band. Whenever the float was in the air, the band played. When the bearers rested, the drummers kept time. It was a very slow, solemn procession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floats were so large that it was a real challenge to navigate through the narrow streets. Turning corners was especially dramatic. The bearers took two full minutes to slowly rock back, forth and forward to shimmy the huge float 90 degrees. When the job was complete, the crowd clapped and cheered in appreciation as the float headed off down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, a second procession came by. Hooded figures, then an even larger float of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by dozens of large candles. It was very dramatic in the twilight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the Mary float made its way around the corner, we left the crowd and went in the opposite direction to find some supper. Our time in Granada was coming to an end. It&#39;s a beautiful city. The mix of cultures and traditions is very interesting and the history, like everywhere else we&#39;ve been so far, is thick. I just want to sit down with some history books and really get the background on these places. But we keep moving on. Time to pop a few Gravol and head to the bus station...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How Do You Leave A City Like Sevilha?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/how-do-you-leave-a-city-like-sevilha/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We bid a fond farewell to Portugal in Tavira and climbed on the ALSA bus to Seville. There are no trains between Portugal and Spain this far south, so a four hour bus ride was required. But the ALSA buses are comfortable and they have electrical outlets between the seats so all was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been getting pretty good at these 3-4 hour bus journeys by now. A perfect travel day starts with a 7:30AM alarm. Shower, pack and head off for a breakfast of coffee, orange juice and toast (tostas or toastadas.) If we like the pastelaria we are in, we&#39;ll buy a couple of sandwiches to eat on the bus. Otherwise, we&#39;ll stop somewhere else on the way back to our room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in our room, it&#39;s a quick bathroom break, then pick up our bags and head to the bus station. The perfect departure time is 12 noon, so we aren&#39;t rushed. Then we arrive at our destination by 3 or 4 pm, which is plenty of time to find our room, meet our host, and go for a first walk around town. Especially with Spanish time, this gives us a half day in our new town. Although our hosts think we&#39;re crazy to waken before 10AM for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus ride into Spain was quite an adventure. We were stopped at the border for over 30 minutes. Inspectors came on board, looked at us sternly, then took the driver off for a while. No passports were checked, but when we stopped for a break in Huelva, a Norwegian passenger I was chatting with said the border inspectors were upset that there were not fasten seat belts signs on the back of every seat. Our bus only had them every six inches and on the window. So the driver was fined 300€ on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&#39;t much of a change in landscape between the eastern Algarve and western Andalucia, but there is a change in agriculture. The orange orchards are replaced by mile after mile of plastic hoop houses. We were too far from the fields to make out what was growing under these greenhouses, but the plants looked happy. With the spacing of the plants my best guess is that they housed young orange trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/BdjQcIF72E-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/BdjQcIF72E-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tranquility of the Algarve, entering Seville was a big culture shock. We exited the bus station on a massive eight lane road, completely jammed with cars, people packing the sidewalks and city busses buzzing by. And the maps.me app gave what seemed like crazy directions to our apartment. We left the busy boulevard soon enough, and seemed to be directed around in circles, twisting and turning through progressively narrower alley ways. At one point we even went through the inner courtyard of a row of buildings, or so it seemed (to be fair, there was a street sign on the wall leading into the courtyard.) But suddenly we popped out into a delightful little square ringed with food shops, walked down a busy street with sidewalks narrower than our suitcases, turned left and were at our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was heaven. Pure heaven I tell you. Seville is the most amazing city, and if we hadn&#39;t agreed in advance to visit other places I would still be there. I don&#39;t think I could see it all in twenty years. Our flat was right near the Plaza Alfalfa (ah, memories of home) and if I never left the square I would still be happy. There were no less than three pastelarias on the square! I know! Plus three restaurants, a charcuterie place, a pharmacy and a playground in the middle. Then in the block between the square and our flat, there was a killer artisan bread bakery (also with coffee, orange juice and amazing pastries), two killer tapas bars (one so small and so constantly busy we never did get a table), a fruit market, a mini super market, and a florist. I&#39;m not exaggerating even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The streets in Seville, at least in the central area, are very narrow and winding. We were continually getting lost, walking for an hour then popping up at Plaza Alfalfa again, or ending up at the Cathedral when we thought we were heading away from the Cathedral. But the great thing is that every single street, and I mean every, single, street is beautiful and interesting and packed with beautiful people. Sevillains (as we called them) are extremely fashion conscious and yet again we felt like frumpy foreigners around them. Had we wanted to, and had the 1000€ it required, we could&#39;ve changed our look in an afternoon. The streets were lined with the most fashionable shops imaginable. Beautiful, colourful, stylish dresses and more suits, in more colours, than I have ever seen. There were many, many specialty clothing stores just for kids too - you can never start too young in Seville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Seville is that it&#39;s tough on photographers. Everything is just so bloody big, it&#39;s impossible to get things in the frame. Seville&#39;s Cathedral is the largest by volume in the world. It took over 100 years to build and let me tell you, it&#39;s a big &#39;un. It took forever to walk around, and would have even if the streets weren&#39;t clogged with tourists. Big, gothic and gaudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seville was the richest city in the world for a time, and it shows. When the Spanish colonized the Americas, Seville was awarded the contract to administer all the wealth coming from the New World. Ships laden with riches made their way up the Guadalquivir River to unload at Seville. So the city is full, and I mean full, of palaces, cathedrals and statues. The University of Seville is also right downtown and the main building is full of marble halls surrounding a massive courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, the most opulent structure in the city is the Plaza de España in Maria Luisa Park, and it&#39;s rather new. The park itself is huge and right downtown, full of statues and fountains and trees and formal pathways. But the Plaza is simply massive. Built in 1928, the plaza is a massive semi circle of connected buildings with a canal in the middle. Bridges connect the centre of the plaza and the outer ring, over the canal. Around the outer ring are a number of alcoves with scenes of Spanish provinces done in tile. We didn&#39;t know anything about the plaza before we stumbled on to it, and let me tell you it was quite a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our time in Seville was spent wandering the streets, looking in shop windows, eating picnic lunches in parks, eating tapas in the evening and generally getting lost. One afternoon we took a pedestrian bridge across the river to the suburb of Triana. At the base of the bridge on the Triana side was a wonderful indoor farmers market (perfect for picking up fruit, bread and Jamon Iberico for our picnic) and a park beside. Lunchtime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The streets of Triana are laid out in a grid, and it seems when the Spanish have room for a grid, they also have room for extra wide plazas. A massive roundabout at the base of another bridge forked into three wide avenues, one of which was pedestrian only. We walked for at least a mile from the roundabout to a fountain at the other end of the plaza, window shopping and finding the perfect gelato along the way. The street was full of happy people, most of which were locals enjoying the sunny afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did more window shopping in Triana than we planned, since it was now 3pm and we were fully into the afternoon siesta time. Most shops in Spain close in the afternoons. They&#39;ll be open from 10AM - 1:30 or 2pm, then close until 5pm or 5:30. Then they&#39;ll stay open till 8 or 9pm. So we gazed in the shop windows and thought of how much money we saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the plaza didn&#39;t empty. Oh, no. The stores closed but the bars were entering into their busiest time of the day. Along the plaza and the side streets were tiny bars full of people, standing shoulder to shoulder and spilling into the street. Businessmen, old ladies, moms with strollers, construction workers. Everyone. And they all had a glass of beer or wine in their hand and a small plate of tapas on the table. Sardines, olives, cheese, ham. Heavenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted for a gelato stand and sat out on the street, watching the world go by. Then we made sure to get a little more to eat too; after two days in Seville we had learned that we wouldn&#39;t be eating supper any time soon. You see, the bars and cafes are for little bites only. For supper you need a restaurant. And restaurants don&#39;t even open until 8pm! The bar/restaurant combo places close from 6-8 too, so make sure you aren&#39;t hungry during the Canadian supper hour, or be sure to pack a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were enjoying the local areas more than the tourist areas, so in our last day in Seville we headed in the opposite direction from our beloved Plaza Alfalfa toward the Alemeda de Hercules. Legend has it Seville was founded by Hercules and this long, wide Avenue celebrates the legend. It took us a while to find it, but the avenue was worth the hunt. Two tall pillars stand at either end of this long pedestrian walkway, with people walking down the middle, cars along the outside, and shops and cafes the whole way along it. It was a smaller version of the Avenue de Liberdores in Lisbon, and not as chic, but we loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/PSWOc9u97k-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/PSWOc9u97k-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we walked back down toward the river, around the bull ring and back toward the Cathedral for the evening. Our waiter at breakfast had recommended some places to eat and hear flamenco. We had a long night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was a restaurant near the Cathedral that offered a private flamenco concert in the back. A drink, tapas and front row seats. This was a professional quartet; a man playing guitar, a young woman and young man who danced, and a matron (who was in reality quite young) who sang. It was an amazing show. Lively, exciting, colourful and full of passion. We were blown away. It was a wonderful show in an intimate venue, but it was quite polished compared to what we saw next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second stop was a small bar closer to our apartment. We nearly missed it. There was a tiny sign over the door that was difficult to notice, but the fact that people kept going in two by two was a hint that something was happening. But inside was empty. Just a grizzled old man in a heavy wool sweater, tending an ancient fireplace just inside the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked past the man and turned down the hallway, following the faint sound of guitar. Then we came into a large, low room, more like a garage out back, with long benches filled with people and a bar off to the side. Flamenco music and male singing was coming from somewhere in this mess but I couldn&#39;t see where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found it. Over in the corner, where only a few people could really see, were three men. They were all seated. The oldest man was about 60 and he played guitar. The man in the middle was younger, say 40 years old and sang. And the man on the left, small, clad all in black, with a pony tail and beard like in a tequila ad, clapped, chanted, then got up and danced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played and danced for 20 minutes or more, while people jockeyed around them for a better view or jockeyed to the bar for another drink. Where the first show was polished and electric, this performance was dark and smoky and passionate. We were swept away by the romance of the whole thing. I should be back there still, sweeping floors, washing glasses and listening to that haunting music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m a family guy at heart so after the performance we left that bar, arm in arm, and just wandered the streets of Seville one last time. It was getting on to midnight now and we started thinking about finding our way home. But then we&#39;d see some people on the corner and would wander by to check out that bar. Or we&#39;d hear music and head down to the next corner. Finally we heard more guitars and more singing, and walked down one more block to a square with three restaurants beside each other. In front of the middle restaurant was a long table with a dozen or more men, all with guitars or mandolins. It looked like a meeting of a local guitar club and they had decided it was time to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/-a9UbiY6DD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/-a9UbiY6DD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how long they had been playing before we got there, but they played for an hour longer at least. One man would sing. One would play a solo. Everyone sang the chorus, with gusto. A few men would come out into the gathered crowd and ask women to dance. Another passed the hat and bought beer for the players wth the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/xyBiHmU13d-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/xyBiHmU13d-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seemed like it wouldn&#39;t end. One or two men would pack up, then 10 would perform a song. The lead singer would come back out from the bar for one more song. Then there were 8 players, then 6, then 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, oh so slowly, the mini-concert ended and we wandered back to Plaza Alfalfa, wishing we could stay in Seville forever. Get cleaned up, buy some fashionable clothes, get jobs in a pastelaria and spend our nights singing and dancing and holding hands in a plaza we never knew existed before and may never find again.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Brussels</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/brussels/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/brussels/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re fine. But I&#39;m a little spooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sitting in a cafe in Córdoba, Spain, having a late lunch, when the TV cut to the bombings in Brussels. As you no doubt know, two bombs went off in Brussels and if I can read Spanish properly, the authorities found a third that failed to go off. Many people dead. In southern Spain, according to the news at least, people are worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the height of their Easter festival here and I would assume it&#39;s prime time for something nasty to happen. Although, personally, I&#39;ll be more worried when we head north in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &#39;the day after&#39; as I write this and things seem normal here, although there are a lot more police patrolling the cathedrals and main tourist areas this morning. We toured the Mosque/Cathedral this they checked our bags before we went in. There were three Muslim fellows in front of us in line and I&#39;m sad to tell you that they made me a little nervous. But I guess that&#39;s what happens when anyone could have a bomb strapped to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men made some other tourists nervous too, mainly with the pictures they were taking. Two tourists talked to security, who then spoke to two police officers (who were walking around with their shotguns out) who then spoke to the Muslim men. We watched for a while as they police gave their papers a very good look. One of the Muslim fellows spoke good Spanish (thank goodness) and had a long, calm conversation with the police officers. We left before it ended but it appeared that everything was going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s not a good time to be Muslim and walking around in Europe. Or from what I&#39;ve read, the USA either. I don&#39;t know about Canada, but I assume it&#39;s not much fun at home too. And I get it, I guess. But there&#39;s something that&#39;s sticking in me, especially because all this is happening when we&#39;re in Córdoba, where the main attraction is the Mosque/Cathedral. After the Roman&#39;s left, this piece of land was a Cathedral in the time of the Visigoths, then a shared Muslim/Christian space, then the largest Mosque in Western Europe, then a Cathedral only. All with a span of 1300 years. Recently, Muslims have been trying to get access to the space to pray again and the Christians aren&#39;t going to let that happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point being that all sorts of people have lived in this land for many, many hundreds of years. Some times one group is in power and the other are suppressed. Then things change and another group is in power. But always someone in power, someone gets the short end. Roman, Visigoth, Muslim, Christian, Monarchist, Republican, Fascist, Republican. It doesn&#39;t matter. Somebody wants to get rich and can justify taking things. Then we justify keeping things, and fearing &#39;the others&#39; until someone comes and takes it from us. It&#39;s true in Spain and it&#39;s true in Saskatchewan. And it makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been walking around a very beautiful city this morning; beautiful specifically because of the mix of cultures who have built this place. And all I can think about is fear and hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can think about is whether humans are doomed to always fear or hate &#39;the others.&#39; And whether we are doomed to be ruled by someone, be it a warlord, King, President, MP, MLA or CEO who gains and keep power by playing on those fears. And what would it take for us all to really, truly, live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll keep on travelling, with our eyes open, and with our hearts open too. And I&#39;ll try really hard not to get nervous just because the guy beside me looks different than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. More light hearted travel fare tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Algarve #3: Chilling Out In Tavira</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/algarve-3-chilling-out-in-tavira/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will: Driving around the southern coast of Portugal, sampling some of the most fantastic beaches in the world; subsisting on oranges, strawberries and dark chocolate for most of the day; arriving in the eastern Algarve town of Tavira and parking in the first lot we could find (as is our habit); then trying to book a guest room for the next three days on your smartphone. By the time we had finally secured a room, it was late, my stomach was growling and I was sunburnt and worn out from all the driving and cliff climbing. So then imagine heading out to find dinner, turning the corner and seeing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a beautiful square, Roman bridge over a still river and a narrow street lined with restaurants to get your blood flowing again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the kids all take bus tours to Lagos to party the night away, mellow baker couples book into a guest house in Tavira for three nights and stroll around the town square and along the river. And that&#39;s exactly what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest room was huge, with a balcony overlooking the Main Street and a large table to sit at. We had a shared bathroom and kitchen area but we were the only people in the entire guest house for two of the nights, so we had more space than we needed. The bed was firm and the WIFI was fast. This room will be the benchmark for many weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first meal in Tavira we relied on our guidebook and the first &amp;quot;single dollar sign&amp;quot; suggestion was Churrasqueria O Manel and it did not disappoint. The specialty of the house is Piri-Piri chicken; Manel&#39;s been grilling it up, over charcoal, every night for over 30 years. We spoke with his daughter who said he developed the recipe from his travels in the Navy as a boy and let me tell you he knows what he&#39;s doing. We gorged ourselves and the next night picked up a bit takeaway for supper at the guest house. Yup, we ate at the same place two nights in a row. It was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tavira gets a lot of tourists and we had our first experience with &#39;tourist pricing&#39; on the trip so far. Our usual breakfast, coffee for me, fresh orange juice for Cindy, and two pastries typically costs between 5 and 6 euros. But it was 10 euros on Tavira&#39;s sunny square. It was fun, but I&#39;ll take the tiny bar in a side street pastelaria any day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The east side of the Algarve doesn&#39;t have the tall cliffs like the southwest coast. Instead, the coast is all marshland and salt flats. They do a nice trade in sea salt in Tavira and area. But they do have beaches, you just need to take a boat to the far side of the lagoon. In the high season there&#39;s a ferry right from the town square, but since this was winter and only a sunny 20c, we walked 2km to the outer ferry station to catch the hourly ferry to Ilha de Tavira. We had plenty of time to make the 11 o&#39;clock ferry, but we decided to check out the market on the way and cut it a little close. We had to cover the last 1100 metres in exactly 11 minutes or wait an hour for the next ferry. We just made it, we walked on just as the pilot cast off from the dock. All it took was, as Cindy calls it, walking with purpose. I tied my loose shoelace on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach at Tavira was excellent, but completely different than the high cliffs and heavy surf of the west coast. Ilha de Tavira is a big sand dune, 11km long and up to 1km wide, with a long, uninterrupted sandy beach on the ocean side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked and walked along the beach, but there wasn&#39;t really that much variation, so we headed back to the section near the ferry station and sacked out on a pair of lounge chairs. We were just about finished the lunch we had packed when a man came by and told us the chairs required payment. Who knew? We apologized, blamed our Canadian-ness and left in a hurry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we heard a band playing off in the distance and saw a crowd gathering, so we wandered over to see what was going on. We got caught up in the first Easter procession of the season in Tavira - bands, town officials, church groups, Boy and Girl Scouts and two large floats went throughout the town, stopping at several stations along the way to the Cathedral. The stations were really interesting because they were permanently set up. The doors were opened just for the procession, but they are there on the street the rest of the year. But if you weren&#39;t from the town, you&#39;d have no idea what was behind the wooden doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tavira is a wonderful little town and I highly recommend visiting, especially if you want to relax for a few days. It was the perfect way to end the Portuguese leg of our Great Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tavira, we got on a bus for the Spanish border and the delights of Andalusia. But we really, really loved Portugal. Great sites, great food and wonderful, friendly people, from the hustle and bustle of Lisbon to the tiniest villages of Monchique and Odeceixe. We loved every minute in this beautiful country and can&#39;t wait to visit again. There&#39;s so much more to see. We could&#39;ve stayed longer in Lisbon. We never made it to Sintra, or even Setubol and Troia. Not to mention the northern cities of Porto and Coimbra, or the ruins at Conimbriga, or the Duoro valley. There&#39;s another long trip in there, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a wondeful evening in Odeceixe, we slept very well and slowly got packed up to continue our trip down the west coast of Portugal. It was Saturday morning, so we figured there must be some pastelarias open even in a village as tiny as this. I was very pleasantly surprised to see a Paderia (bread bakery) sign on a side street, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hMNyqdN2pM-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/hMNyqdN2pM-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Bread bakery down a narrow side street&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to check every side street. Magic awaits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the bakery was very small but the shelves were full of bread, buns and croissants. I had my morning coffee and pastry and tried, in my best Portuguese, to explain that I was a baker and their bread looked very good. I made some sense, because the clerk called over the owner (who spoke very good english) and she invited us next door to the bakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner&#39;s mother, a delightful elderly lady who only spoke Portuguese gave us a tour of the shop. Two huge mixers, a big work bench, and a massive deck oven. The bakery was spotless; the bakers came in at 8pm Friday night to do the baking so by 10am Saturday, all the work was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she surprised the heck out of me. She took us around the side of the oven and showed me a room with wood stacked floor to ceiling. The deck oven was wood fired! There was a small firebox beside the deck oven which held the fire. I don&#39;t really know how she regulated the heat, but I think the fire heats a boiler and the oven is heated by circulating hot water (you can buy gas fired &#39;steam tube&#39; ovens in North America.) Still, I don&#39;t know how they could adjust things in a wood fired oven that large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we were back on the road, heading south along the coast to Arrifana. It&#39;s an area that came highly recommended by the lady at the Faro tourist office and it did not disappoint in any way. We parked high up on the top of a cliff, far too scared to drive down to the beach, then walked along the top, through a small village, to a point overlooking the Atlantic. Sheer cliffs and broken rocks were all around us, with the surf pounding the rocks below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looked dangerous and it was. We saw a steady stream of locals walking and driving north to the edge of the cliff. When we looked out past them, we saw a rescue helicopter and two boats alongside some particularly nasty looking rocks. We couldn&#39;t make out their objective, but the helicopter flew so low, and hovered for so long, that I&#39;m certain they were performing a rescue. After 20 minutes or so the helicopter left and the locals went home. I hope whoever they were helping are alright today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went down to the beach, along a narrow, twisting road with three switchbacks and a steady line of camper vans and surfer dudes. Arrifana is a surfing hotspot it seems. There were surf lessons going on at one end of the beach, and a stream of fit and sexy surfers along the rest of the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t surf, but we did walk along the beach, wade into the water and marvel at the cliffs around us. This beach especially was extremely shallow close to shore, so we could walk out a long way without getting to wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an leg burning hike back to our car, we drove for an hour further down the coast to the very tip of Portugal and the European continent, Cabo St. Vincente. It&#39;s the western most point in Europe, and if I looked really, really hard in the west I&#39;m sure I could see New Jersey. Perhaps not. But we scrambled over the rocks as close to the edge as we dared (we were still very high up above the water) watched the fishermen bobbing violently in their boats near the cliff walls, had a nice conversation with two travellers from Minnesota, then headed east, back into Portugal, to another beach we had passed on the drive to the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not exactly sure of the name of our final beach of the day, but it was just east of Cabo St. Vincente. It didn&#39;t seem possible, but the water was clearer, the surf was livlier, and the cliffs more spectacular than any of the beaches we had been to so far. Perhaps it was because the hike down was steeper and more treacherous than any other; no cobblestones here, just irregular steps with many of the rocks broken away. Or maybe it was because there were no more than a dozen people on the entire beach. But it was thrilling, and we dawdled along for over an hour here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end of the beach, were the sand, surf and rocks met, there was a little cave that we could just get to without swimming. It opened into a huge cavern, open to the sky above. We imagined that this is where we could hang out if we were abandoned on a desert island. We&#39;d survive in the cave, until the tide came in at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it was one more hike back to the car and a final push along the highway. Through Sagres, Lagos and Portimao, stopping beside the highway for another bag of oranges. East past Faro and Olhao, and on to our final stop in Portugal, Tavira. Here the guidebooks, Cindy&#39;s research and the Faro tourist office lady all agreed - Tavira is a delightful place to finish a tour of the Algarve. But that&#39;s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Temporary Photo Fix</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello from Spain.  The last two posts have been missing pictures.  I hesitate to blame technology (heck, 12 years ago you&#39;d all be waiting for me to come back and process the films) but I&#39;m blaming the technology.  It&#39;s gotten too good for the type of posting I&#39;m trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-picture-plan&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Picture Plan &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, here&#39;s how the blog will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll post stories about the trip.  Some long, some short little snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also bulk upload a selection of pictures to a special gallery in my SmugMug photo sharing account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll link to the gallery at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures in the gallery will be roughly sorted into the same order which I talk about things in the post.  But they won&#39;t likely have a caption per picture.  Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s two galleries to get you caught up with the last two posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallery for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Evora-Post/&quot;&gt;Evora: Step Back.  Step Way Back.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallery for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Algarve-post-1&quot;&gt;The Algarve Has Been Logged.   You Must Visit Anyway.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-details-for-those-who-care-about-this-sort-of-thing&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Technical Details For Those Who Care About This Sort Of Thing &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-temporary-photo-fix/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some detail for the geeks in the audience.  I won&#39;t feel bad if you stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is built on a self hosted Wordpress site.  I&#39;m writing my posts on a new iPad and posting whenever I have access to Wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the official Wordpress iPad app to post.  I&#39;ve tried posting straight from the Safari browser too and still get the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, as I see it, is that the image files from my new iPhone and Cindy&#39;s new camera are just too big to upload to my self hosted site.  Whether I upload the images from the Wordpress app or the Safari browser, and whether a bulk &#39;add media&#39; operation or from the post editor, the upload hangs up before it is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can upload the files to SmugMug with no problem.  OK, it takes forever, but it works so long as I leave the iPad alone for an hour per post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I resize the images and reduce the file size, it works.  But there&#39;s no automatic resize capability with Apple Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 3rd party app to do the resize, and it works, but individually resizing each photo, then getting back to the Wordpress app, finding the space in the post, loading and embedding the picture, etc. Is just taking too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent over 5 hours on my Estremoz post alone and we were almost in Spain before I had time to finish it and post it.  At this rate I&#39;ll be home and Christmas will come and I&#39;ll still be posting about the trip.  Cindy and I want to see new things rather than sit around uploading photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get home, I can quickly resize the photos on my PC, or just upload them to Wordpress from my computer/proper internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other change I could make is to see if my server has a file size restriction that I don&#39;t know about, which may be causing the issue.  Ie, don&#39;t allow uploads of more than 2mb from Europe.  But that&#39;s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smugmug solution doesn&#39;t give an awesome reading experience.  Having the pictures in the right place in the post is better.  But at least this way I can stay more current and people can see pictures too.  I know Cindy&#39;s mom wants to see more pics.  So that&#39;s one person anyway, and a pretty important person at that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Algarve Has Been Logged.  You Must Visit Anyway.</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-algarve-has-been-logged-you-must-visit-anyway/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/the-algarve-has-been-logged-you-must-visit-anyway/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Embedding photos is still a bear with my iPad.  But if you want to follow along, &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Algarve-post-1&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a photo gallery covering the areas we went to in this post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our tour of dolmans and megaliths was over, Libanio dropped us off near our apartment. We ran upstairs, grabbed our bags and walked (&amp;quot;with purpose&amp;quot; as Cindy says) down the alley,through the city gate, down the road to the bus depot and straight on the bus to Faro. Five minutes early, I might add!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faro is the capital of the Algarve region of Portugal. It&#39;s the most southern strip of the country, bordering Alentejo on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, Spain on the east and the Mediterranean Sea on the south. You might say it&#39;s the Tourist Area - pretty much all my Canadian friends who tell me of their winter escapes to Portugal go to the Algarve for the beaches, golf and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we could see the beach, we had to go through the mountains on the northern border of the Algarve. While not tall be Rocky Mountain standards, they were a big change from the rolling hills of Alentejo. While we travelled on the main north/south highway, we traveled straight through, but as we exited for the various bus stops on the way the roads twisted and turned quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, our first impression of Faro was poor. But we were on the bus, travelling too fast past hotels, shopping malls and outlet stores. And of course the bus depot was in a seedier area of town. But as we walked to our guest room for the next two nights, the streets opened up and it was really quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying in the &amp;quot;old city&amp;quot; which dates back to the 13th century and was full of our favourite narrow cobblestone streets. And just outside the city walls were 6-8 twisty blocks of pedestrian only streets full of shops, pastelarias, gelaterias and restaurants. Plus, being on the Mediterranian coast, Faro had a harbour, with a long promenade that we walked at least six times, to and from our room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the weather was sunny and mild for us, around 18C, you could tell it gets hot in the summer, since all the streets had white sailcloth stretched between the buildings, providing shade for the shoppers. So we walked around the shopping district, then over to the public garden (with more of my coffee kiosks!) and to the local library. We spent an hour browsing the stacks, looking for books we recognized, even if we couldn&#39;t read them since they were all in Portuguese. Although I did browse through an interesting history of Portuguese postage stamps and learned stamps were called &amp;quot;selo&amp;quot;, which really would&#39;ve helped at the post office in Evora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we were at a crossroads. Before we left home, we planned on traveling to the Atlantic side of the Algarve, but the bus schedules were against us. Many of the areas we wanted to visit are hard to get to in the height of summer, and are pretty much impossible to reach in low season. One bus in at 9AM, one out at 9PM, etc. We&#39;d be spending all our time and money on bus rides and not see anything. So we decided to break our pre-trip promise and rent a car. We found a place near the airport which rented cars with automatic transmissions (they had exactly one in stock) and after promising with our lives that we wouldn&#39;t damage it further (it was already missing one light and had dents in all four corners and all four sides) we were on the highway to Monchique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief word about European cars. I love them. We were driving a Citroen, and though I really wanted a tiny Fiat, or a jazzy Renault even, the Citroen was fine. But their automatic transmissions are really strange. I think they just took a manual and slapped a robot shifter on it. There&#39;s no &amp;quot;Park&amp;quot; so the car will still roll on you and shifting through the first three gears was as rough as if I were shifting myself. Plus there&#39;s &#39;eco&#39; mode, where the engine shuts off at stops and restarts when you release the brake. I thought it was stalling for the longest time. I will learn to drive a manual next trip, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the taxis to the airport, rental contract stress and &#39;Eco&#39; mode, I was getting rather agitated. Hungry too, because we did all this before breakfast. So we decided to stop in the town of Sao Bras de Alportel for a bite. One wrong turn had me trying to park on the narrowest street in town but we survived and were fed. From this point we parked at the first blue &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; sign on the outskirts of each town in which we stopped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tummies full, we headed west toward Silves.  This off the beaten track town is renowned for its castle which was built, modified and rebuilt by both the Moors and Christians.  While the exterior of the castle is intact and old, the &amp;quot;rooftop&amp;quot; interior has been added to recently, with a rather smart walking path, garden and restaurant.  Plus, there&#39;s a nice exhibit on the plight of the Iberian Lynx in a massive indoor chamber, which was originally a water cistern in Moorish times.  Boy, even the water cisterns are amazing to behold!  We spent an hour or so roaming around the castle, ate lunch on a bench admiring the castle walls and palm trees, then hiked back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final destination the first day was Monchique, a tiny village deep in the Algarve hills. The drive to Monchique was superb. Clean, smooth pavement, no traffic at all, my lovely navigator beside me helping negotiate roundabouts and all around us, blue skies, high hills, deep valleys and tiny villages with their white houses and red roofs clustered in pockets on the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/2jHs1c_9D9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/2jHs1c_9D9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kind grandma selling her oranges beside the highway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound are way through the central Algarve for over an hour until we got to Monchique, hastily parked the car and found a room for the night. We stayed in a nice room at a B&amp;amp;B right beside the tourist office, staffed by a tiny old lady who was so small she couldn&#39;t reach the board on the wall to get our room key. All she wanted was 40 euros cash and assurance that we&#39;d leave the keys at the desk. Oh, and we needed to understand there would be no breakfast tomorrow. I think we were the only guests that night and it was too much bother to make breakfast for one. That was no problem, because Monchique has a lovely square at the very bottom of the hill town which just begged to be occupied in the early morning sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were up early, checked out and put our bags in the car. But then we left the village on foot; we had a mountain to climb. Monchique is near the Foia, the highest point of land in Portugal. At 902 metres, it isn&#39;t anywhere near the tallest mountain in Europe, but it was the tallest here and within our grasp. So we wound our way through the village, past the convent and started on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4km walk was tougher than I expected. I guess my climbing legs didn&#39;t stick with me once we left Lisbon, plus the trail was very rough. Lots of loose rocks and quite large rocks at that. It also didn&#39;t help that there weren&#39;t many trees after the first kilometre or so. We had great views of the surrounding hills and saw that there weren&#39;t many trees there either. The entire surrounding hillside had been clear cut, including a large section of the trail. We walked through churned up land, logs and stumps. Where new trees had been planted, and only a very small area had been replanted, the native trees were replaced with tall, straight and foreign Eucalyptus trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Evora, Libanio told us many landowners are growing Eucalypts for pulp and paper production, since they grow so fast. But they need a lot of water and don&#39;t add to the undergrowth in the forest. So what you get is trees growing on what looks like rough gravel, with no foliage underneath. And where there were no Eucalypts, entire hillsides were bare or covered with a tight, dense, green blanket of waist high thorn bushes. It was a much different walk in the woods than we were used to at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we kept walking and gingerly picked our way up the trail, and it wasn&#39;t too long before we reached a paved road up to the summit. The road was paved because the summit of Foia is used for cell towers. There&#39;s a little village of maintenance huts and towers at the very top. But the views all around the summit were amazing. Hills and valleys and villages and fields surrounded and on a clear blue morning we could see for miles. We had bagged our first peak. We&#39;ll be sure to do this again in the Netherlands. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got back to the car, we took off north and west, along twistier roads than the day before, over and out of the Algarve hills and out to the Atlantic coast. The roads were amazing. So twisty that I could only drive 50-60 km/h but I was the only car on the road. So we took it easy and cruised to the west coast. Before long we left the hills and got back to straighter roads and farmland. Then, cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southwest coast of Portugal is known for its high cliff sides and crashing surf, dotted with gorgeous sandy beaches. There were dozens of beaches along the coast, too many to see them all, but we went to three on the west side - Zambujero do Mar, Odeceixe and Arrifana. Zambujero do Mar was the furthest north, so we drove there first. It was stunning. A tiny resort village with buildings right up to the edge of the cliff, then, far below, a U shaped beach of smooth brown sand and amazing blue water. There were two or three tiny cafes at the edge of the cliff with incredible views so, of course, we picked the prettiest one for lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an amazing lunch, we were sad to learn that access to the beach was blocked. Construction crews were rebuilding the cobblestone road and sidewalk leading down to the beach, so the beach was closed. It was so frustrating to see all that beauty and not be able to get a closer view. But we were very close to our goal for the day, so we got back to the car and drove down the coast to Odeceixe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odeceixe (pronounced O-da-saysh) was the real reason we rented the car. Long before we left home, Cindy read about this tiny village on the west coast border between Alentejo and the Algarve and wanted to go. She asked everyone we met about Odeceixe and they all agreed it was beautiful. So how could we miss it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village is 3km from the coast, along a river that flows out to the ocean. We stopped in the village, found a room for the night (I think it was the first time the room was used this year) then drove down to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our guidebooks talked about walking along the river to the beach (the hike was what caught Cindy&#39;s imagination) we drove rather than walked because, well, we&#39;d already climbed a mountain in the morning. It was a good call, because there wasn&#39;t really a trail along the river anyway. We would&#39;ve just been walking on the roadside and it required a lot of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach at Odeceixe was splendid in every way. Restaurants, cafes and beach houses at the top of the cliff, a glorious clean, pristine beach down below, crashing surf and great light since it was almost sunset. This beach had the added bonus of a second freshwater beach where the river emptied into the ocean. We walked all over the ocean side, then followed the river upstream for a bit, waved hello to the fishermen on the opposite river bank and generally smiled a lot. It was a beautiful sunset in a gorgeous setting. We drove back to the village, ate a pizza and drank too much wine at a cafe in the village square, I sampled some of the local hooch (a liquor I can&#39;t pronounce mixed with honey - delicious) and we staggered back to our room and fell asleep instantly. What a full day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Evora:  Step Back.  Way Back.</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi.  I&#39;ve been having a terrible time this week getting photos up to the website.  First Cindy had a problem with her camera (fixed) then I can&#39;t seem to get strong enough WIFI for the pictures to upload.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than wait, and forget where I was or what I was doing, I&#39;m going to post some updates picture free.  Then when I get pictures loaded, I&#39;ll post a photo gallery or something.  Sorry about that!  Mark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: let&#39;s try this.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://madbaker.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-2016/Evora-Post&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a link to a photo gallery of our Evora pictures.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, here&#39;s what happened in Evora...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the skies cleared from the afternoon rain shower, we left Estremoz and headed back to Evora. Evora is the capital of the Alentejo region and is a sight to behold when you come in the late afternoon, from the northeast, and gaze upon the hill and the cluster of white walled houses gleaming in the sun. Then you pass under a massive aqueduct that trails off into the countryside, ride alongside the tall city walls and finally pass through the walls, on foot, to your flat in the inner city. It&#39;s romantic as all get out. Cindy and I bounced along the Main Street into the city, then through a maze of progressively narrower alleyways until we met Maria, our Airbnb host, and got the keys to our apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to our cramped top floor flat in Lisbon, Maria&#39;s apartment was massive. We entered into a large living/dining room with our bedroom off the side. To our right was a massive kitchen with stone floors and an ancient chimney over the stove, a large marble sink and a 10 foot ceiling. Maria works in a restaurant and clearly loves food because the kitchen was laid out for serious cooking. The bathroom was through the kitchen at the back of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only challenge with Maria&#39;s apartment was that, like Evora outside, and Alentejo in general, it was COLD! The region is designed for the long, hot, dry summers and the buildings are designed to stay cool. Portuguese people just bundle up and get through winter, I guess. So there&#39;s no central heating and no way to really get the house warm. So we wore our outdoor clothes inside again and dreamed of buying sweaters and slippers once the shops opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way Maria&#39;s tiny portable heater was going to subdue her large apartment, so we closed the door to the kitchen, sacrificing it and the bathroom to the cold. We propped the heater between the living room and bedroom and let &#39;er rip. With the help of a few blanket/shawls we were fine. So long as we remembered to put on shoes when heading to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evora is very old. That is to say, there&#39;s been a city on this hill for a very long time. It was a major centre in Roman times. There are ruins of a temple at one of the high points of the city, and the remains of a Roman bath under City Hall. But the current city was built on top of the Roman plan in the 1500s AD. That&#39;s right, what we&#39;re looking at and walking around is &#39;only&#39; 500 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evora has an intact set of city walls, so the population of 40,000 either lives &amp;quot;inside the walls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;outside the walls.&amp;quot; Although with everyone living on compact streets and in tiny apartments, I suspect a great majority of people still live inside the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Evora is built on a hill, with all roads leading to the central square, it helps to imagine the city like a clock. The square is in the centre of the dial, but stretches across the face towards 9 o&#39;clock and 3 o&#39;clock. The Roman era Temple of Diana is still in the middle, but towards 9 o&#39;clock. The Cathedral is just to the left of centre, and the wide &amp;quot;central&amp;quot; square is more to the right, toward 3 o&#39;clock. With me? Then let&#39;s take a tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came into Evora from the bus depot, outside the city walls, right at the bottom (6 o&#39;clock.) Our apartment was right near the entry to the walled city, but let&#39;s say at 7 o&#39;clock. But our first adventure was a further away, right at 9 o&#39;clock beside the temple of Diana. That&#39;s where we found the aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing cities need lots of clean, drinkable water to feed its population. And in hot, dry Alentejo, the lack of drinking water was really holding Evora back. So the Romans built an aqueduct to carry water from the river in the hills 15km outside town. That is to say, they built a 15km long gravity fed stone water trough that steadily and consistently flows down from springs in the distant hills to the end point high up in the hill city of Evora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Rome, the aqueduct fell into disrepair, but was rebuilt in the 1500&#39;s and again in the 1800&#39;s. It still looks ancient and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the endpoint of the aqueduct near the ruins of the Temple of Diana. Even though at some points the structure towers 30 feet overhead, the endpoint is a small building no more than 6 feet above ground. But from there the structure extends along the street, outside town, then turns left and runs past a convent and into the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the land rises and falls, the aqueduct must maintain a steady slope, dropping at most 10m every kilometre. So at times, the structure is quite low to the ground, or even goes underground in places. But when the land falls away, the aqueduct is the largest thing in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed its path along the road, around the convent, and through farmer&#39;s fields for 4 kilometres until we&#39;d had enough. The sun was setting soon and we were a good distance out of town, so we found a road that would loop back to the 6 o&#39;clock gate into the walled city and followed it home. We climbed quite a bit into the hills while following the aqueduct, so the downhill stroll home was a nice treat. It was an idyllic evening, cool and clear. We even had to stop for a herd of cows to cross the road to get back to the barn. 60 cows and calves with a single farmer following behind and calling instructions to the herd. How lovely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we spent a lot of time walking and exploring the side streets off the main square. We saw the temple of Diana and walked up to the massive Cathedral, then down to the University of Evora (2 o&#39;clock), which dates to the 1700&#39;s and is right at the edge of the city walls. We found a very cute pastelaria near the University that was so good we tried to go again the next day, and got wonderfully lost before giving up. Then we turned the corner and there is was. Many of the pastry shops get all their products from the same bakeries, but our favourite was different. The lady behind the counter was the same lady who did all the baking and was in the dozens of pictures on the wall, each time posing with a local celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around from the University toward the southeast corner of the city (4 o&#39;clock) is a wonderful, large public garden. When the cities are full of buildings and cobblestones and cathedrals and ruins, it&#39;s nice to have a green space. In the afternoons especially, the park was full of kids playing and people just hanging out at one of the several bar kiosks throughout the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word now for these amazing green beacons of joy. Throughout Portugal, in parks, plazas and public squares, you will find a tiny green kiosk with small tables and red chairs in front. These tiny oases are fully stocked - ice cream, candy, water, espresso, wine, beer and a fully stocked bar. Some even have newspapers and magazines and lotto tickets. Often they even have a TV on in the corner showing a soccer game. What an immensely civilized structure! I have yet to pass one without smiling and I can&#39;t pass three without stopping for an espresso. Why are there not 7 of these spaced around Wascana Lake?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our final morning in Evora, Cindy arranged a special treat. She contacted a retired University professor named Libanio Merteira Reis to take us on a tour of some sites around Evora that were very old indeed. Much, much older than the Romans. Before the dawn of recorded history, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archeologists have found evidence of settlements on the Iberian Peninsula from the Neolithic age. That is, from the time of the very first humans, over 30,000 years ago. And the area around Evora contains some of the best discoveries on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some context setting at a local museum, we took off into the country in Libanio&#39;s Volvo. Our first stop was a cave near Escaurol. In 1963, some quarrymen blasted a hillside to loosen it up a little and found a cave entrance. Inside the entrance were human bones. Archeologists took a look at the remains and the cave beyond and realized that the bones were, in the whole scheme of things, rather recent additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the miners had really created was a new &#39;back door&#39; into a sanctuary where it is believed that early humans have gathered for tens of thousands of years. But they would have entered through a long, narrow tunnel that opened up into this larger sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tours to the Escaurol caves are tightly controlled. Only around 1000 people are allowed in each year, so we felt very fortunate to be allowed inside. In the sanctuary are faint paintings and etchings in the rock wall. Horses heads, pregnant cattle and other symbols. They are very tough to see and many are covered over in places due to calcification on the cave wall. But still, we&#39;re talking the very, very beginning of human civilization. These markings are from a time when humans first started to settle in one place; to move from being hunter-gathers to forming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we left the cave and continued our drive through the beautiful Alentejo countryside, Libanio told us that these caves were used as burial chambers for the mightiest members of the group. And when a cave wasn&#39;t available, the community would build a structure called a &#39;dolman&#39; to replicate a cave. We were off to see a very large dolman now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m sure you know about the pyramids in Egypt, right? Massive burial chambers, really. So now imagine a very similar things being built, several thousand years earlier, in what is now Spain and Portugal. Huge stone slabs cut from local hills, hauled and stacked to form a round structure with an opening facing the sunrise. A hallway extending the opening, built of smaller stones. Then cap stones over the whole thing. And then, the entire structure being buried to create an artificial hill, with an artificial cave inside. That&#39;s a dolman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, the soil around the dolman eroded, exposing the stones. We were able to climb up the back side and see inside (the cap stone was dragged off and broken by an early archeologist many years ago.) Each of the side stones was truly huge - at least 12-15 feet above ground. Now, 10,000 years later, it looks like a pile or rocks, until you realize that people had to cut them with only Copper Age tools and haul them without the invention of a wheel. Remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final destination on the tour was a Really Big Deal. The Megaliths - a group of 90 standing stones set in an oval pattern to denote the changing of the seasons. Similar in purpose to the other standing stone sites like Stonehenge, but 3,000 years older than their more famous English cousin. And with several of the stones having engravings and symbols on them that are still visible if the light is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s the thing. You can walk right up to them. Walk around them. Contemplate them. Think of what they mean and how the site was used. I hear there&#39;s a big rope around Stonehenge so you can&#39;t get close, but we could take a rubbing on the stones if we wanted to (we didn&#39;t!). With the exception of the Escaurol caves, all these sites were free, open and fully accessible. Fun and scary at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private tour with Libanio was our first &#39;big ticket&#39; item of our trip but it was oh so worth it. Libanio helped us put our visit to Evora into real context. Yes, we were tracing the steps of the Romans and the Renaissance Portuguese, but in Evora we were also retracing the steps of some of the very earliest human settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really got me thinking about my life in Regina. I mean, we tell people that Regina is just over 100 years old. And yes, there were the First Nations people before that. But I remember a visit I took to the petroglyphs near Willow Bunch when I was a kid. I need to get back there soon and reconnect to the first peoples of North America too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what I was thinking after Libanio dropped us off in Evora mere minutes before our bus out of town. We were leaving Alentejo and heading south, into the Algarve. But that&#39;s for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Estremoz:  To Market, To Market</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/estremoz-to-market-to-market/"/>
		<updated>2016-03-10T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although there was much more to see around Lisbon, it was Friday so it was time to move on.  We found our way along the metro to the bus station and booked our tickets to Estremoz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estremoz is a very small town in the Alentejo region of Portugal, that is, the south central region of Portugal that borders Spain to the east and the Algarve to the south.  &amp;quot;Alentejo&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;beyond&amp;quot; and refers to the area beyond Lisbon and the Tagus river.  It is an extremely beautiful area, especially for a Saskatchewan boy who has been dealing with the crowds of Lisbon.  Rolling hills, fields surrounded by stone walls, farmhouses with white walls and courtyards and grassland dotted with cork trees.  Open space but with lots to gaze upon too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t get the history of it, but Estremoz must have lots and lots of marble nearby.  The entire town is beautiful, pink marble.  The cobblestone sidewalks are small pieces of pink marble.  The curbs are small slabs of marble.  Heck, the bus station is all marble!  Harbour Landing homeowners would be seeing kitchen countertops at every intersection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estremoz is a compact town on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding farmland.  And what does one put on top of a hill with great views of the surrounding territory?  A castle, of course!  Estremoz castle isn&#39;t as big as Castelo Palmela, but it&#39;s got all one needs; narrow, winding streets weaving their way up to the castle, walls surrounding the castle and church with a nice walking path around most of the hill, and a gorgeous set of steps down to the town centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the castle and church has been turned into a &lt;em&gt;pousada&lt;/em&gt;, a state run hotel and restaurant complex for people much wealthier than I.  Many of the castles and churches in the country have been converted to pousadas in order to fund their upkeep.  It&#39;s certainly a different way to see the country than our Airbnb apartments and guest houses.  I don&#39;t begrudge the wealthy their comforts, because the pousadas were nice to look at on our way to the town square and our modest room for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We booked a room at the Hotel O Gahdana, a two star hotel just off the main square which was recommended in Cindy&#39;s guide book.  At 40€ for the night it was a tiny splurge but was well worth it.  It was a mansion compared to our tiny flat in Lisbon; wide hallway, spacious room and a shower that let me stand upright.  And the staff were amazing.  Only the night supervisor spoke any English, but we listened hard, played a bit of charades and worked everything out with the day crew.&lt;/p&gt;

Wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got to play charades at the tiny restaurant down the street where we went for supper.  We held out till 7:30PM but were still the first customers of the night, although the five other tables filled up soon after.  We did our best to navigate the Portuguese menu; Cindy knew she was getting fish and I knew I ordered pork, but beyond that we had no idea.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Both plates were huge and delicious.  Two big plates, plus bread and wine, plus the desert of the house (which was delicious) for under 25€.  Incredible.   I&#39;m pretty sure a 1/2 litre of local wine was 3€, which is so cheap I wish I could handle a litre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the real reason we came to Estremoz wasn&#39;t for the castle, or the wine.  It was for the market!  Each Saturday, Estremoz is home to one of the largest farmer&#39;s markets in all of Portugal.  Cindy set an alarm for this one.  We weren&#39;t going to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have to remember, early March is still late winter in Portugal.  There&#39;s not much on offer, or so they told us.  But I&#39;ll tell you what, there was more selection at the Estremoz market than most Regina farmers markets.  Huge bins of oranges, lemons, potatoes, carrots, almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts. Strawberries!  Peppers! Winter squash so big that they sold them buy the chunk.  One fellow even had a basket of huge avocados from his two trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were baskets of eggs that you could pick out and put in the carton yourself.  Some grandmas just sat on a bench with a basket of eggs to sell.  They didn&#39;t even need a stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of it was live!  There was a row of sellers with chickens, ducks, geese and rabbits in cages.  We learned this is prime rabbit season and were a little scared of one old gentleman who gave his rabbit a good looking over before agreeing to take him home.  I thought he was going to ring its neck right then and there. Over the course of the morning dozens of people took their Sunday dinner home in a cardboard box with airholes cut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway through the morning, we got another treat. There was an off-road racing event just out of town, so all the trucks in the event held a parade through town.  Three laps of honour around the square.  I thought it was an incredible racket, but lots of the old fellows stopped to have a look.  (In the afternoon, there was a second parade of muddy trucks, but not near as many people stayed to see that one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered our new favourite market snack.  It&#39;s called Fartura and is the Portuguese version of a churro, or beaver tail, or elephant ear.  Fried dough in sugar.  What could be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two Fartura stands.  One run by an old couple (Sir fried the dough while Madam mixed the batter, portioned out the Fartura and took the money.) This booth had a line all day long.  We waited 10 minutes and we were lucky.  The other stand was run by a young man and I never saw a single person go to that stand.  There&#39;s an interesting story there but my Portuguese isn&#39;t strong enough to get the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique trick to Fartura is the batter is squeezed out in a continuous, circular spiral, flipped as a single unit, then cut (by madam) into long sticks and then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Two sticks made up one portion and most people bought two or three portions to take home. We tucked into ours before we had even left the line. Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much more to the market.  One seller specialized in pet birds, from tiny chickadees to peacocks.  There were many plant growers selling bedding plants (they&#39;d pull 20 plugs of lettuce or carrot or tomato seedlings, put them all in a plastic bag and sell them for 1€) and fruit trees.  I would&#39;ve bought an orange tree for 7.50€ but it wouldn&#39;t fit in my suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, beside the farmer&#39;s market was a flea market; row after row of antiques, used books, pottery and clothes.  There was even a man selling a table full of Russian cameras and Soviet military hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/8UtfcZ0NU2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;a flea market stall of colourfully painted ceramic bowls.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my favourite sellers, bar none, were the three young girls selling cake by the slice.  They had baked three cakes at home and had them displayed on a wooden table.  For 1€, you got a slice of the cake of your choice, cut to order and wrapped in a napkin.  The Regina health inspector would pass a large stone at the thought, but I&#39;ll tell you what, we put the paper wrapped cake in Cindy&#39;s pack and ate it a day or so later.  I&#39;m still able to write about it and never even got the shakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By around 12:30 it had started to rain, so all the sellers packed up and headed to the bars, pastelarias and snack bars around the square for a drink and bite to eat.  We ducked into a pastelaria too, for coffee, hot chocolate, a pastry and a box of cookies for the afternoon bus to Evora.  It&#39;s only a one hour ride, but you can never be too prepared.  Emergency cookies are an important component of every traveler&#39;s kit.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/a-magical-meeting-in-palmela/&quot;&gt;In our last episode&lt;/a&gt;, our intrepid travellers embarked on an adventure full of distant train stations, steep switchbacks, and chance meetings with intensely interesting people.  But it was time to hit &amp;quot;post&amp;quot; and they were still on top of Castelo Palmela, trying to determine their next move.  Will they make it down in one piece?  Will Cindy ever see Setubol?  Will Mark get his mid-afternoon espresso?  Read on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was getting toward 6pm and our amazing day in Palmela had to end. We were tired, footsore and hungry. Reluctantly, we made for the train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we were also feeling extra happy and brave, so we decided to take the gravel short cut back to the train station. Remember, it was on the map app, and we could see the path clear as day. So off we went, hand in hand. We were walking through the Portuguese countryside, just as we had dreamed, and if it was only for a few kilometres between towns that was just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Our path below&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes up must go down, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got a little interesting though, when the map showed a fork in the road and we couldn&#39;t see the fork. Oh there it is - our route was no longer a road, but a walking path. Then a little further, it got smaller still, to a single bike track. Then the barbed wire fences and the &#39;Private Property&#39; signs. (At least I think that&#39;s what they said, they were in Portuguese.) Soon, the muddy descent on a now washed out path. But the path is on an app! It has to be real! As we descended the hill, the fences kept narrowing towards us on the left and right. We were being funnelled to a point, but couldn&#39;t tell if there was a break in the fence at the point.  Just when I figured I&#39;d have to boost Cindy over some barbed wire, there was a break in the fence so we didn&#39;t have to wreck our new travel clothes. At least not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/zmgugzp50x-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/zmgugzp50x-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Mark on a very narrow path&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we were near some houses again. Gated estates, actually. With high walls and lots of noisy dogs, enraged at the intrusion on their domain by two tasty looking Canadians who straggled down the back of their property. Luckily, the path (which had now widened to a trail again) led between two of these estates and we nervously stumbled back onto the highway. Right near a McDonalds no less. We were in Aires again, and limped the final 2 km to the station relieved that we actually knew where we were going. No more map apps tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

I looked easier from the top!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled on the train and headed back to Lisbon.  I was so tired.  I tried to watch the three young folks play cards beside us but could never figure out their game, and besides, I kept nodding off in the middle of the hand.  But I was also very, very hungry.  We resolved to find a place to eat between our metro station and the big hill right before our flat, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting looking side alley just before the big hill that Cindy had wanted to check out all week, so this time we went down.  It quickly forked into two even smaller allies, with three restaurants all in a row (left side, middle point and right side.) Left side was too fancy; white tablecloths and black aprons.  The middle point looked really good, but only had empty tables outside, and we were too cold to eat outdoors tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right side was different.  Colourful.  Lively music you could hear from the street.  Tables mostly full, but room indoors.  Menu on a chalkboard.  We figured why not and went inside. Called Tas&#39;Ka, it looked like a coffee bar or lunch counter that had been repurposed to be  a restaurant.  But it sure smelled good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They serve African food that is representative of the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique.  It had only been open for a week and all the food was created and cooked by a lady we could watch from our seats. She was legit; cooking Real African Food,  just like mom and grandma.  At least according to Anna Dika, the lady seated beside us, who is without a doubt the biggest fan of Tas&#39;Ka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of or meal, Anna helped us order and checked in on every course to make sure we liked it (we did.)  She was appalled that we were drinking water, so got us two glasses of wine so we could taste the food properly.  When we didn&#39;t order one of her favourite dishes, she made sure our waiter brought some by to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn&#39;t enough, it turned out that tonight was our waiter Clarence&#39;s birthday.  Anna and six or seven other people were at the restaurant to make sure Clarence was celebrating properly.  Cake was served.  Shots were poured.  Songs were sung, including Portuguese Happy Birthday, which we were lucky enough to know already (we learned the Brazilian version and it was close enough.) So we made two new friends and had cake too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our bellys were completely full, and Anna had filled my notebook with places to eat in Alentejo (our next destination), we were allowed to leave Tas&#39;Ka.  We got back to our flat and were fast asleep in under 10 minutes, I&#39;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a day! Other than seeing the castle in Palmela, we didn&#39;t do a single thing we had planned.  But we had a month&#39;s worth of adventures in a single day. That&#39;s what travel is all about - I just never thought it would happen to me.  But I really hoped it would.  I&#39;m a lucky guy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A Magical Meeting In Palmela</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cindy rousted me out of bed by 9:30 because we had a big day ahead of us. We were going to take our first train across the river and out of Lisbon. Just a short trip today. 40 minutes to Palmela and then 5 minutes further to Setubol. Palmela is known for its Medieval castle with amazing views so we definitely wanted to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ticket process was a little confusing, but we had 20 minutes to figure it out before the train left. And we nailed it in 10. Every station has an information booth, but we&#39;ve yet to see a booth with a person in it. Beside the booth is a kiosk with a few English words and far too many options. But there&#39;s often a helpful passenger to guide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling around the greater Lisbon area is actually really easy and very cheap.  There are lots of buses, four metro (subway) lines and the light rail trains to places like Sintra and Setubol.  And all work with a single &amp;quot;Viva Viagem&amp;quot; card.  You buy the card for 0.50€ and then load it up with money at kiosks around every station.  For the metro, you scan the card when you enter the station and again when you leave; the fee for the ride is then deducted from your card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/wl6mp8lpAV-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/wl6mp8lpAV-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;The extremely useful Via Viagem card&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extremely useful Via Viagem card&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge with trains is that you buy a specific fare at the kiosk, and you can&#39;t buy the fare if there are insufficient funds on the card.  So load the card, then buy the ticket.  But what if you don&#39;t know the fare?  You go in circles, endlessly looping around the kiosk menu, until the person behind you in line takes pity and tells you the fare.  4.15€ to Palmela.  And you can only by a one way ticket.  You can go through all this again at the Palmela station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Palmela was hilarious, just like our trip to Belem. We looked out the window, saw the castle way off in the distance, and said &amp;quot;hey, we must be getting close.&amp;quot; Then the train stopped. It seems that Palmela station isn&#39;t actually in Palmela! It&#39;s more on the far side of Aires, the town beside the train tracks. The castle looked very far away indeed, but we figured we were in good shape, so we tightened our shoelaces and started trekking.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, better get walking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aires was nice. Tidy and colourful apartments with nice gardens. A modern school and smooth sidewalks. We were making good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/1QM7wZ1gc9-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Walking through Aires&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through Aires. The castle road must be around here somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of Aires was the hill with the castle on top. Now how are we going to get up there? My maps.me app didn&#39;t show any access other than the main highway, so we headed on up. The road was busy and the sidewalk got narrower and narrower as the road got steeper, first heading away from the castle then switching back toward it. At its steepest, the road narrowed so there was no sidewalk, then no curb! Just a concrete drain beside the busy road. So we took to the drain. After about an hour of this all told, we arrived at the Palmela cemetary, then a side road where we could duck into town. We jogged into town and into a wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/P5mtLgKuW2-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/P5mtLgKuW2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Palmela&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmela is a medieval hillside village that is still active and vibrant today. And it&#39;s beautiful. Windy cobblestone streets with shops and a market and a sun soaked view of the beautiful Barris Valley far below. We had just arrived via the back side of the village, that&#39;s all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/e18t-SjDnm-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/e18t-SjDnm-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;the outside of the cafe&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite cafe in Palmela. It has the best view!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for a delightful lunch at a cafe and then walked across the street to a lookout, where we gazed back at the route we came up. The train station looked way off in the distance. And right in front of us was a wide white gravel road with two people trekking up to us. That looked much quicker! And hey, gravel roads are on my maps.me app too! More on that road later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Jt9fBe8OGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Looks like a shortcut&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Looks like a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue up to the castle right away, Cindy wanted to stroll through town first and find the market. So we weaved our way through the maze of streets and alleys until suddenly the view opened up and we got this amazing view of the Barris Valley. Beautiful! Sunny and green with an orchard to the right, forest to the left, and a winding road connecting tiny farms and vineyards in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/osfsUxWX8t-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/osfsUxWX8t-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;bustling palmela&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustling Palmela.

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fpAUQMt7Kd-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Barris Valley&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Barris Valley. Lovely!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grinned stupidly at each other forever.  Grin to each other, gaze out at the valley below.  Look back at the town.  Grin to each other again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several minutes of grinning and gazing, a waiter from the cafe beside us came up with two glasses of wine from a man sitting at the cafe. I&#39;m not kidding! We drank the wine (even Cindy, who never drinks red wine) and went over to thank the man, Tilak, and he introduced us to his daughter Rita and her partner Nuno. We visited a bit and Cindy show them her photo book of Regina life and then Tilak asked if we had 1/2 an hour and did we want to see more of the valley. Hell yeah! So we all piled into his 4x4 and drove out to the Barris Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/RWiWbMyEjw-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/RWiWbMyEjw-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmela and the Castle from the valley floor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valley is lived in and farmed but is also part of a protected area. The landowners and the government work together to keep the valley in its rural state even though there is pressure from Lisbon suburbs on one side an Setubal suburbs on the other. (As Tilak said, the government gives the protections and the landowners pay for everything.) But from the valley floor you forget about the cities on the other side of the hills. It&#39;s just wonderful country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rita drove us over a hill and into the neighbouring Arrabida valley, where they lived. Tilak bought his place 35 years ago and has been slowly turning his piece of the hillside into what he calls a Mediterranean nature preserve. He&#39;s got plants from all over the world there that grow well in the hot Mediterranean climate. Aloe plants from his native Africa. Over 17 species of bamboo from his time working in Asia. All planted in and around the native cork trees and other native plants on his hillside acreage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years he&#39;s also built a number of buildings on his land and they are now turning them into apartments to rent to tourists and house the fire brigade during the dry season. We toured the apartments and would gladly live in any one of them, for months or years. What a glorious place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilak had to get back to Lisbon so we said goodbye to our new friends and he dropped us off at the castle in Palmela at around 4pm. Oh right, the castle! I almost forgot why we went to Palmela in the first place! The good news was we had the place almost to ourselves at that time of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We clamoured all over the castle.  It&#39;s virtually untouched (I only saw one iron railing along extra steep stairs) and we could go all the way to the very top.  No way the authorities would let you get right to the edge at home!   It was thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the view was spectacular!  You could see south to Setubol and across the inlet to the beaches of Troia.  And then we turned north and could see Lisbon way off in the distance.  Filipe told us this was a very strategic castle because of the view and I could really sense that.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>To Belem and Back Again</title>

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/to-belem-and-back-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friends of Orange Boot Filipe and Linda both recommended a day trip to Belem, so we headed down to the train station right after my morning trip to the &lt;em&gt;pasteleria.&lt;/em&gt; We went to a new one this morning, a block down from yesterdays&#39;s adventure and whoo boy was it humming.  A man and woman plating pastries as fast as they could.  Another woman constantly pulling shots.  And another man running - and I mean &lt;em&gt;running -&lt;/em&gt; to take food and drinks to tables and return with empty cups and plates.  I barely nudged him with my pack while standing at the bar and I knocked him right out of orbit!  He kept his stack of plates together, barely, but asked us to take a seat after that.The coffee was even better than yesterday and the pastries were great too, but we&#39;ll try a new place tomorrow.  This one was so busy I was quite intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then further down the road to the Mercado da Ribeira, a large indoor market right by the train station, to pick up some fruit for the train ride.  According to our guidebooks, this is the main market, the Granville Island or Pike Place of Lisbon, if you will, but we must&#39;ve got there late because there wasn&#39;t much going on.  Fruit, vegetable, flower, fish and meat vendors, to be sure, but no shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half of the market was a series of restaurant booths.  Like a big food court but with really good looking food, all cooked in open kitchens.  It looked really nice, although all the cooks looked very serious indeed.  We didn&#39;t stop to eat as it wasn&#39;t noon yet and we had a train to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re still getting used to the locals here, especially with regard to the weather.  By the time we reached the train station, which was right along the river, we were down to shirt sleeves.  The sun was out, the wind was calm and it was warm - already 15C.  One  cafe had beach chairs along the water and they were full up with tourists sunning themselves with drinks at hand.  But the locals?  Winter coats and scarves still.  I wonder when spring arrives for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/go7l_25grD-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/go7l_25grD-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; alt=&quot;deck chairs along the river&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourists sunning themselves beside the river.  The locals are still wearing winter clothes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were expecting a long ride.  The guidebook said 30 minutes by tram and a friend said 40 minutes.  So we made sure to grab nice seats and hunkered down for the ride.  The train was hot and stuffy.  I had a pretty good sweat going and started looking for a window to open but then looked around and everyone else had heavy coats and scarves on.  I guess it still wasn&#39;t warm enough.  So I did some Mark-style meditation and breathing exercises to slow my heart down and cool myself from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train rolled and we came up to one of the two big bridges that span the river.  This one looks a lot like the Golden Gate in San Francisco.  It towered over us and over the city as the freeway passed over the houses to meet the road half way up the hill.  As we went under the bridge, Cindy pointed out the spot where we took pictures of the aqueduct yesterday (the aqueduct goes over the freeway once it meets the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the train slowed down and we were at Belem station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/hxIxUnWx5K-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/hxIxUnWx5K-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; alt=&quot;Belem train station&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh?  We were on the train less than 5 minutes!  How can this be Belem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off, found a bench and checked the map.  Belem was not much more than 5km from our flat!  We had pretty much walked there yesterday and didn&#39;t know it!  I think what happened is that the 30-40 minute estimates were for trams.  Lots of stops and travelling though the hilly, narrow streets of Lisbon.  But the train is a straight shot on level ground.  Much, quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Belem.  Very, very nice.  Like, gorgeous!  The touristy bits of the area are all along the water and it&#39;s quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you have the river, with a nice walking promenade and an immense sculpture, the Tower of Belem.  The tower sticks out over the river like the prow of a Portuguese caravel, which is exactly the point.  The tower commemorates the Portuguese explorers who were among the very first to colonize much of Africa, Asia and South America (plus coming to Newfoundland too.)  These were the first fellows to bring the riches of the world &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; to the motherland.&lt;/p&gt;

(That&#39;s going to be a common theme on this trip, I&#39;m afraid, so I&#39;ll say it once and be done with it.  Vast riches were secured by a few people, often from colonies around the world.  These riches, and the people of the colonies too, were used to build the magnificent buildings Cindy and I will see all over the trip.  We&#39;re taught to feel guilty about all that today, or at least I do, even though we live in a former colony too.  But still.  These buildings and squares and statues are magnificent.  So I&#39;m going to enjoy them.  End of downers...)
&lt;p&gt;After the river comes a strip of beautiful, manicured parks.  Three in all, each with a central statue or fountain, smooth paths and lots and lots of benches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9N9pjdVi-i-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/9N9pjdVi-i-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Marble Fountain in Belem&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the parks is the Main Street, full of colourful houses, then full shops and bars, and then a splendid palace and museum.  The street was crowded with tourists (including these two from Saskatchewan) so we made one pass then moved inland, to stroll through the neighbourhood a little.  We found houses, the football stadium, then lots of gates and barbed wire.  There are several embassies in Belem, and we passed Austria, South Korea, Japan and Peru before we were back downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/ECP1Z6b1LE-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;park with houses in distance&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belem is famous for a specific pastry, &lt;em&gt;pastel de nata&lt;/em&gt;.  It is a custard tart, ideally served warm and was invented in Belem in 1837.  The shop that made the tart famous is still there and still making them. And even though you can buy &lt;em&gt;pastel de nata&lt;/em&gt; in every &lt;em&gt;pasteleria&lt;/em&gt; in Lisbon, there was a line out the door at this shop.  They&#39;ve apparently done quite well in the past 175 years, since they now have a 400 seat restaurant to go with their takeout line.   We passed, then came back an hour later when the line was gone and bought two tarts plus a pair of duck and mushroom pastries for supper.  We ate them in the nearby park.  Delicious!  The custard is just slightly sweet and it is a real treat when still warm.  Well worth going to the source!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another stroll through the parks, we went back to Lisbon and up to the top of Parque Edouardo VII, which we enjoyed so much yesterday.  But instead of a side trip to aqueducts, we walked back to our flat down the middle - the Avenue de Libertadores.  Two large pedestrian promenades lined with shops so fancy I hadn&#39;t heard of most of them.  We stopped for my afternoon espresso and then took a quick left so Cindy could see one of the &amp;quot;elevators&amp;quot;, a tram on a track that goes up and down the steepest streets.  Wow, and I thought we&#39;d been up some steep roads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevator was at the foot of a magical series of narrow streets and alleyways known as the Restauradores district.  You guessed it.  Restaurants!  Theatres too.  The already narrow streets were full of tables.  Each group of tables had a waiter or restaurant owner with a menu to show to passers by.  &amp;quot;Sir, look at my fish in the window!&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Remember, our name is Santiago!&amp;quot;  And some of the theatres had huge lines of kids camped out for tickets.  I couldn&#39;t figure out who was playing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was another long day of walking, so we grabbed a quick dinner, checked on the kids then went to bed before we could look at our pictures.  So this post will be a little late.  But we have another big day tomorrow so need to sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if it was jet lag, the firm mattress, or the intense cold in our flat but I slept like I haven&#39;t slept in years.  Cindy finally gave me a kick at 9:30 and mentioned we might want to leave the apartment.  So after navigating the teeny shower I dressed in outfit #2 and we hit the cobblestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/f8zamuvduC-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/f8zamuvduC-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy at the front door of our AirBnb in Lisbon&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day was complete in the first 20 minutes.  We stopped in at a nearby &lt;em&gt;pasteleria&lt;/em&gt; (pastry shop / snack bar) for breakfast like the locals: standing at the bar.  I had a delicious coffee and croissant while Cindy had fresh squeezed orange juice and a sausage pastry.  We were standing between a sweet old lady having the same coffee as me (I wasn&#39;t too shy to point and ask for what she was having) and a young businessman who was in an out while I was still figuring out what to order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was over the moon happy.  I&#39;ve been wanting to have a standup pastry &amp;amp; espresso breakfast &amp;quot;European style&amp;quot; simply for ever.  I&#39;m so glad Sabine used to have her coffee and croissant standing at our hutch when she came to the bakery.  Now I know why she did; what seemed sweet but different in Regina is just the way it&#39;s done here.  And there is literally a pasteleria every block here.  Sometimes two or three!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we walked over to the Feira da Ladra (&amp;quot;the market of thieves&amp;quot;) in the Alfama district.  It was only 3km away but was quite the hike.  They say Lisbon is the City of Seven Hills and I think we covered two of them getting to the market.  We went through Barrio Alto, then Baixa, up and around the back of the castle (Castelo de San Jorge) to a huge cathedral.  Behind and beside the cathedral was a huge arch; we passed through the arch into one of the craziest flea markets ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market was full of, well, everything.  Used books, original art, bowls of old coins, packets of stamps and postcards, posters, and handicrafts.  But also whatever junk and tchotchkes one might have picked up over the years.  Piles of old clothes.  Handmade shoes.  A blanket covered with old, used, possibly hot cell phones.  A bucket of bolts.  Records.  That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around the market and snapped a few pictures, including a stamp and postcard seller for my buddies at the club, and then headed into Alfama.  The Alfama district is renowned for its tight, maze like streets.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like them in all my life.  There was no alley too narrow for a pasteleria, maybe a restaurant, a shop and apartments.  If it was wider it might have a parking garage or even a service station.  We wandered around for an hour or more and pressed tight against the wall if a car (or tram!) came past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in such tight quarters let us take a good look at some of the buildings.  As can be expected in an area that tight, it&#39;s a continuous line of 3-4 story row houses, with the walls coming to within 12-18 inches of the street.  Most of the time you couldn&#39;t walk two abreast without one person having to walk on the street.  But the best part was the tiles!  Many of the buildings were covered in traditional ceramic tiles making a colourful pattern on the wall.  Mostly they were just patterns but we saw one building with tiles making a scene across the whole wall.  I guess this is traditional Portuguese decoration for buildings, and it&#39;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping for a quick lunch (sandwiches and fresh lemonade) we walked to the metro station and took the train up to Parque Eduardo VII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very fancy area, with five star hotels all over the place, but we went to see the park.  It starts with a huge statue in the middle of a roundabout, then a massive green space with a tree lined promenade on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promenade has a substantial slope to it.  We walked and walked to the very top, where there are four large pillars and a big fountain.  The view from the top of the park was amazing!  You could see all the way to the river and  see the castle where we were for lunch just a couple of hours earlier.  It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

Water in the distance, castle on the hill in the distant left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rested at the top of the park for a while then hiked off to find another, smaller park nearby.  Cindy had read about this park in her guidebook - it was right in the shadow of an ancient aqueduct that runs through Lisbon.  What a site!  The park was well treed and shady (nice as we were getting toasted in the sun,) there was a coffee bar at one end and little playground for the kids beside it.  Now we&#39;re talking!  We need one of these park/coffee bars in my neighbourhood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/9eE0HAL3L1-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/9eE0HAL3L1-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;children&#39;s playground under an aqueduct&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy wanted to see more of the aqueduct so we followed it as best we could till we found a park dedicated to it, about a kilometre or so up the road.  For a small fee you can walk along the top of the aqueduct and get some cool views.  We didn&#39;t really want to get any higher but we walked along it for a few more blocks and got some great snapshots of the aqueduct crossing a freeway and curving off to another hill in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/VmWHeJ-u-T-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;the aqueduct continuing into the distance&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was a long, twisty, mostly downhill (unless I screwed up the directions) walk back to our flat.  We decided to eat in so after we cooled off a bit we walked down to a nearby market for some vegetables and tried our best to get the oven to work.  We got it figured out and made a nice, simple meal.  And we only blew the main breaker once!&lt;/p&gt;

At least there&#39;s a railing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip of the Day:  A huge thank you to our friend Deborah, who recommended we download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.me/en/home&quot;&gt;maps.me&lt;/a&gt; app for our phones.  I had a map of Portugal on the phone that I could access off-line.  And it could route walking directions!  It saved us in the Alfama.  We never would&#39;ve found the market and for sure we wouldn&#39;t have found the aqueducts without it.  Thanks Deborah!&lt;/p&gt;

That&#39;s it for 3 months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one thing that every single travel guidebook mentions over and over is to PACK LIGHT!  Pack the bare minimum and leave half of that behind.  And really scrutinize the half you keep to see if you can take more weight off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s something to that, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last &amp;quot;Big Trip&amp;quot; was two weeks to Vancouver, Seattle and Victoria in 2014 and that was a dry run on the whole &amp;quot;carry everything on your back&amp;quot; approach.  We borrowed travel packs that Ben and his buddies had taken to Europe.  Filled them to bursting, checked them at the airport, then swore every time we had to take the pack from the plane/train/ferry to our hostel.  It was brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip is much longer and we&#39;re going to visit many more places.  And that means more days lugging our packs.  I don&#39;t want to say &#39;lugging&#39;, even once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&#39;s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One carry on sized, wheeled travel pack per person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One light day bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal, easy to wash, quick to dry clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very little paper (my books and journals often weigh more than my clothes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10kg (22lb) limit per person.&lt;/strong&gt; 9kg is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight limit is really important. There will be days we&#39;ll need to carry all our stuff and hey, I&#39;m not 20 anymore.  10kg is half a bag of flour so I should be able to carry that without too much grumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/4Nag6R-UBk-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/4Nag6R-UBk-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; alt=&quot;suitcase contents, all laid out&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the stuff. I still wish it was a little less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag:&lt;/strong&gt; Last year I invested in a really good carry-on sized wheeled backpack, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ospreypacks.com/ca/en/product/meridian-convertible-60l-22-MERIDN22_726.html&quot;&gt;Osprey Meridian&lt;/a&gt;, based on the recommendation of the very smart owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robinsonsoutdoors.com/&quot;&gt;Robertson Outdoor Store&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria.  She travels the world, from Poland to Peru and the Meridian is the only bag she takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cool feature is the Meridian comes with a zip off daypack.  When the daypack is off, the big bag meets carry-on restrictions.  Zipped on, I can wheel or carry everything in one streamlined unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve taken a few small trips with my Meridian and it&#39;s a dream as a wheeled bag.  This will be the first trip where I use it as a backpack too; I&#39;m curious to see the proportion of wheeled use vs. backpack use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothes:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m really trying to conserve weight here.  Lightweight pants, 3 shirts, socks and underwear, 1 pair shorts and 1 pair swim trunks.  A fleece and a raincoat.  Shoes and sandals.  We&#39;re going in spring so thankfully won&#39;t have to carry a heavy coat and mitts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics:&lt;/strong&gt; The splurge (money and weight) is my iPad and keyboard setup.  I&#39;ve got travel guides and maps pre-loaded, plus I can blog on the road and FaceTime home too.  It&#39;s worth the weight.  Lots of cables and electrical adapters making the trip too, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy&#39;s carrying her point and shoot camera.  We&#39;ve got an adapter to hook the camera up to the iPad so we can share pictures from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper:&lt;/strong&gt; I can&#39;t get to zero, but I am being strict here.  Two bundles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/&quot;&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt; books for journalling/lists, a watercolour sketchbook, a travelling paint set, pens, pencils and brushes.  I am extremely tempted to take a second sketchbook but will fill the first one and buy another instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy made her own travel guide / journal from the pile of guidebooks we borrowed from the library and is still holding out hope that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp&quot;&gt;Patrick Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; finally publishes his new novel before we get to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Bits:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m banking on Europeans shaving and brushing their teeth, so am taking minimal toiletries.  I&#39;ll buy more when I run out.  And we always seem to collect plastic cutlery, etc. when we picnic, so I&#39;ll get a spork for the next adventure.  A lightweight pack towel was my only splurge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it wouldn&#39;t be a Mark and Cin trip without our Gin Rummy book and a deck of cards.  We&#39;ve had a running game going since 1990 or so.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it.  It all fits in the carry-on bag with lots of room to spare.  But hows the weight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark&#39;s bag: 23lbs (10.4kg)&lt;/strong&gt; Argh.  Too many Field Notes?  Too many socks? That iPad+Keyboard put me over the limit a touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cindy&#39;s bag: 21lbs (9.5kg)&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty darn good.  She can carry the toiletry bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell.  If we&#39;re carrying the packs a lot and it&#39;s too much, we can either chuck some stuff, mail it home, or get in better shape...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of planning a long trip is figuring out where to go and what to do.  But do you really need a strict itinerary?  I don&#39;t think so, especially for a trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our son Ben and his buddies went on a six week tour two years ago, they had the trip fully planned before they left Saskatchewan.  All rooms were booked in advance:  Two nights in London, a week in Rotterdam, a week in Lisbon, etc.   They didn&#39;t want to be stressed out finding accommodations while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben&#39;s trip worked pretty well.  One AirBnb host cancelled in the middle of the trip but they had time to rebook.  So they were never searching for rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem they faced was that they couldn&#39;t adjust their plans on the fly.  Bordeaux was boring for four young men, but they had paid for five nights accommodations, so they stayed.  Lisbon was awesome and they&#39;d love to stay longer, but their Barcelona apartment was paid for and waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my trip, I want to avoid too many commitments.  If Evora is amazing, I want to stay longer.  If we get invited to a village bakery, we&#39;re going.  I don&#39;t want to say Sorry I can&#39;t go if an opportunity presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, it helps to have some idea.  So this is what we&#39;re doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I built a calendar for the 93 (!) days we&#39;ll be away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I inked in the two fixed dates:  Arrive in Lisbon, depart via Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We marked in key dates from the Real World.  When&#39;s Easter? (Expect southern Spain to be packed Easter week.)  When are any cool festivals we want to see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used pencil and sticky tabs to block out week long blocks, going forward and backwards.  At the start of the trip, we want to have time to visit more of Portugal than Lisbon, so that gets two weeks.  At the end, we want time to cycle in the Netherlands, so that gets a week.  We want to linger in Paris on route to Holland, so another week there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first run through is like a filled chocolate:  semi-firm on top and bottom, but soft and gooey in the middle.  For example, we really have no clue how we&#39;ll make our way from northern Italy to Paris, although we know we&#39;d like to be in Paris by May 10 at the latest.  And we know that if May is approaching and we&#39;re nowhere near Veneto, we had better re-think things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read through guidebooks and get ideas from our friends, things may firm up a bit.  What&#39;s happening so far is that we&#39;re finding more and more things we want to see. That will increase for sure once we land in a few weeks.  But there are a few people we want to visit so it&#39;s good to at least commit to the month that we&#39;ll be in their country!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to go slow and deep into the places we visit, so the lack of a fixed itinerary will help with this.  We&#39;ll need to make a lot of decisions as we go, but that&#39;s part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know we won&#39;t have enough time to see everything we want on this trip.   Unless we sell the house.  Our kids have instructions of what to do if we call with the &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; code.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/my-kingdom-for-a-guidebook/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.avif 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.avif 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.webp 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.webp 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-700.jpeg 700w, https://markdyck.ca/img/fSgcX3ivCC-1280.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/fSgcX3ivCC-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;a large stack of travel guidebooks&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of temporary unemployment is there is plenty of time to plan this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our route slowly takes shape, I&#39;ve been getting guidebooks from the library.  And as I read through them, I&#39;ve been putting more books on hold.  We&#39;ve got quite a collection at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#39;ve learned so far is that there is way more to do and see than we can fit in a single trip.  So we&#39;re not going to try.  We&#39;re going to go deep in fewer areas, rather than doing a Rick Steve&#39;s &amp;quot;two days per city&amp;quot; whirlwind tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach has served us well when travelling in Canada.  Our two weeks in Prince Edward Island is half a lifetime compared to the guidebooks - they&#39;d have you on and off the island in 48 hours.  But there is joy and wonderment in the little villages as much as in the famous cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the guidebooks?  I tend to lean toward Rough Guides, even if we&#39;re not going to be staying in hostels very much.  Fodors and Frommers tend to be for people with higher budgets than we have (at least that&#39;s the sense I get.). Lonely Planet might be a good fit but isn&#39;t available at the library much so I haven&#39;t formed an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIth our &#39;go deep&#39; strategy, the individual country or region guides (Portugal, Paris, Andalucia) are a better match than Europe in 500 pages.  The regional books have room for smaller, quirkier places in addition to the big names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;general overview&amp;quot; books have been helpful too.  Rough Guide&#39;s &amp;quot;First Time Europe&amp;quot; or Rick Steve&#39;s &amp;quot;Europe Through the Back Door&amp;quot; get you in the right frame of mind for travelling, rather than talking about where to eat and what to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all this book smarts can only give us the basics of a region.  I can hardly wait to get there and see Europe with my own eyes, meet new people, and follow my nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been too long since Cindy and I were on a big adventure.  After working like crazy at the bakery for the past five years, it&#39;s time to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve always dreamed of a European Tour, but have never been.  So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going.  Roughly counterclockwise from Lisbon, to Italy and north to Paris and the Netherlands.  Or so we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights are booked (into Lisbon, home from Amsterdam.)  Guide books checked out from the library.  A few more weeks of dreaming then we&#39;ll be getting on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends have asked if I&#39;ll be publishing a blog of our adventure.  Well, sure!  Don&#39;t have to ask me twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re getting started early.  Before we leave.  This blog is all about travelling - getting ready, getting there and getting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not travel experts or anything.  We&#39;ve travelled around North America alone and with kids, but we&#39;ve never left the continent.  So I fully expect some of our world traveller friends to cringe while we stumble around our first overseas trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not be pretty, but it&#39;ll be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I used to have a travel blog called &amp;quot;Ready With Shoes On&amp;quot;, so we could send dispatches back home during our epic European tour in 2016.  This was the &#39;About Us&#39; page from the blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Cx5nI82zbS-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Cx5nI82zbS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; alt=&quot;Mark and Cindy&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi!  We&#39;re Mark and Cindy Dyck and finally, after years of dreaming and planning and plotting and scheming, we&#39;re taking our dream trip to Europe.  Three months of walking and hiking and trains and buses.  We&#39;re so excited we can hardly stand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve dreamed about this trip forever, but there was always something else to do.  Work, raising two amazing kids, setting up house and even opening a bakery.  But the kids are in University now, the bakery is (temporarily) closed and it&#39;s time for adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re Canadian Prairie folk and proud of it.  And we&#39;ve seen most of Canada over the years (typically in a tent!)  But this is our first trip overseas.   We&#39;re going to travel in Europe the same way we travel in Canada - frugally, curiously, openly and with a focus on the adventures one can find in everyday life. We can&#39;t wait to meet new people, make new friends and experience new cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&#39;s the writer.  Cindy&#39;s the photographer.  Together we&#39;re going to share the little gems that make this trip special to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we&#39;ll be sure to share our screw-ups too.  They&#39;ll be a good laugh for our more experienced world-travelling friends and maybe a good lesson for folks who haven&#39;t made the travel leap yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Making the S+S Case to Small Business IT Providers</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/making-the-s-s-case-to-small-business-it-providers/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/making-the-s-s-case-to-small-business-it-providers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference was in helping partners make the transition to a Software Plus Services world. Microsoft has recently announced that they are offering a series of email, collaboration and productivity tools in an online, hosted model. If you&#39;re an IT Services company who is used to selling and supporting onsite licenses, this could be seen as a Very Big Threat to your business model and livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Microsoft&#39;s value proposition for Partners, in case you&#39;re talking to an IT firm who is feeling a little nervous these days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most customers would rather lose voice service than email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty bold statement there and I just wish my pen was faster, as I missed the specific statistic. But it was &#39;lots&#39; for sure. The premise is that more and more business is done via email today -- so much so that email is the essential service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Providers would rather not have to repair on-premise Exchange servers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic goes like this: If you signed on as the service provider for a small business email system, and email is more important (or at least, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; important) than voice, do you really deal with outages with a single-server, on-premise email solution? Fixing customer outages is not the path to loyalty no matter how good you are. Preventing outages is where it&#39;s at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring revenue streams are a Very Good Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos love them. So does Microsoft. Now IT partners can benefit from the peace of mind that recurring revenue streams bring. As one partner said, once your contracted, recurring revenue stream exceeds your overhead, it&#39;s very easy to sleep at night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers are interested in Software + Services models, if it&#39;s from their local, trusted partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft cited that 70% of SMB customers are interested in S+S. They see an opportunity to free up staff and avoid capital investments. They are especially interested in hearing about S+S from their existing IT service provider partners. Small business trust solutions coming from their local partners -- more so than offers from large corporations like IBM or Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most S+S customers are new to the VAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software + Services provides a solution for the customers who have said No to on-premise solutions. This grows the VAR&#39;s customer base and revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VAR&#39;s can move up-market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VAR who is too small to support a 200 seat on-premise solution may be &#39;just right&#39; to support a 200 seat S+S solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;+ Services&amp;quot; part of the equation is all revenue for the VAR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is clear that there is a difference between S+S and SaaS. They look at partners to deliver the value-added services such as directory integration, application integration, training and end-user support. They see the Services work to be worth several multiples of the Software fees -- anywhere from 2X to 7X depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly aligns with our conversations with TriCon Technical Services. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this aligns with our IT Service Provider interviews later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does SaskTel fit in the value chain with Microsoft, IT Services companies and small businesses? More thoughts on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing #3:  Solution Selling</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-3-solution-selling/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-3-solution-selling/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article is the third from a series of excellent presentations from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; in Iowa, which were presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://partner.microsoft.com/Canada/trainingevents/wwpartnerconference&quot;&gt;Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland CEO Arlin Sorenson gave an excellent presentation on their Solution Selling process which he claims made the difference in growing his business. When you consider he started from his corn farm in Iowa, with 25,000 people in a 30 mile radius, and is now an $18M business with 80 employees in 8 locations, it&#39;s worth hearing how he grew his business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, a couple key assumptions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sales process doesn&#39;t have to be the same as Heartland&#39;s, so long as it matches your products, your customers, and is &lt;em&gt;consistent!&lt;/em&gt; Follow the process every single time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales process is really designed by Marketing. There are tools / materials developed by Marketing that are key to the process. Marketing designs the process, Sales executes the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent processes become necessary once a company grows to a certain size. Prior to that, referrals or independent sales/marketing/engineering effort may be enough. But sooner or later, you need a process to coordinate these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartland&#39;s Sales Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing. The Marketing activities which I described in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; are all designed to drive leads to Sales. The goal is NOT to automatically sell a product. Instead the goal is to gain an appointment with the prospect to begin the next step in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key takeaway: Their systems are set up so that every lead moving to the next step is tracked to a specific marketing activity. Was it a seminar? The third direct mail piece? It&#39;s important to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment. Heartland takes each prospect through a formal assessment process which both uncovers customer pain points and value (in the customer&#39;s words) but gives Heartland the chance to &lt;strong&gt;create customer value from within the sales process&lt;/strong&gt;. They accomplish this by creating a three year technology plan based upon the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Heartland has begun to charge prospects for the assessment and technology plan. This emphasizes the value in the deliverable and prevents customers shopping Heartland&#39;s plan to competitors. The cost of the assessment is rebated back if the prospect purchases services from HTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://partnersalesresources.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Partner Portal&lt;/a&gt; has several sample assessment tools partners can use or modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal: This step generates a formal quote for services based upon the three year technology plan developed in the Assessment phase. The goal here is an accurate quote delivered quickly, in order to reinforce Heartland as a Business Partner, with the distributor relationships required to get the whole job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated deliverable given the large number of distributors and partners Heartland works with. They use tools like QuoteWerks and Infopath to pull from distributor price lists and integrate directly into Heartland&#39;s CRM and ERP systems. I was amazed at the level of integration they have in place today compared to what we do at SaskTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation: Of course, you have to actually do the work. Most companies stop here but there&#39;s still more to be done before the sales process is complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell the Story: This is one of the most powerful steps in the process, because real evidence of a job well done feeds the Marketing effort at the top of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland ensures that every solution over $2500 gets a &#39;Customer Win Wire&#39; -- a one page case study / press release which describes the customer pain, the solution and the business value. It also promotes the partners which were used to solve the customer problem. They are written by Sales using a consistent template developed by Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arlin mentioned that Sales hates writing the Win Wires but &amp;quot;compensation drives behaviour.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Peer Groups, and some final thoughts on what SaskTel can do with these examples.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing #2:   Drip Irrigation</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-2-drip-irrigation/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; shared what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; is doing in the area of event marketing, but that&#39;s not all they do. They have a tried and true direct marketing strategy as well. During his Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference seminar, Heartlands Sales and Marketing VP Larry Hedin shared their top performing direct marketing tactics. Larry calls it &#39;drip marketing.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Deliver a series of oversized &amp;quot;Impact&amp;quot; postcards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Lr6ptQYxOh-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; alt=&quot;HTS Impact Postcard&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS Impact Postcard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland&#39;s mail campaigns are designed as a series to drive home a specific message (ie. the case for disaster recovery services.) The sales force performs follow-up calls after the third mailing with the goal of setting up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: Create a monthly e-newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/qMaOtLGEd2-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; alt=&quot;HTS e-Newsletter&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS e-Newsletter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTS used to do a print newsletter but they soon realized they were spending more money and receiving less information from their customers. They use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constantcontact.com/&quot;&gt;Constant Contact&lt;/a&gt;, an online newsletter management service, to deliver a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/Newsletters/HTSNewsletters/May08_Company.htm&quot;&gt;monthly e-newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and to track open rates and click throughs by topic. That way, they know which prospects are interested and the topics in which they are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry was clear that the purpose of the newsletter was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to sell HTS services. It was to educate and inform prospects, and to get the prospects to take action by clicking through to the HTS website. Each newsletter is built around a topic of current interest, like disaster recovery during tornado season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-newsletter generates real sales results. For example, Heartland sold a Voip phone system to a local school based on a school administrator reading a Voip article in an HTS newsletter. This $70,000 sale has grown into other opportunities in other offices under the school&#39;s control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, over 1300 people are signed up to this free monthly newsletter. Their newsletter is so popular that HTS is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/ymt/enewsletters.htm&quot;&gt;rebranding their newsletter for over 200 other IT services partners&lt;/a&gt; around the country. While intended for marketing Heartland&#39;s core services, the e-newsletter has created an entirely new line of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Up: Solution Selling -- a formal sales process gets results!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Corn Field Marketing: Will it Work in Wheat Fields?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/"/>
		<updated>2008-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/corn-field-marketing-will-it-work-in-wheat-fields/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartlandtechnologies.com/&quot;&gt;Heartland Technology Solutions&lt;/a&gt; is an IT services provider in who take an aggressive approach to marketing to small businesses. It&#39;s been effective -- from their headquarters on a farm in a corn field in Iowa they have grown to 8 locations, 81 employees and $18M in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href=&quot;https://partner.microsoft.com/Canada/trainingevents/wwpartnerconference&quot;&gt;Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in July&lt;/a&gt;, I attended a presentation by their VP of Sales and Marketing, Larry Hedin, where he discussed marketing ideas that work for Heartland. Much of what they do leverage marketing development funds (MDF) from their various hardware and software partners. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Hold Microsoft Across America Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/lCmBprvyRn-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/lCmBprvyRn-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Across America van&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Across America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has seven large trailers which are filled with technology displays, which travel the country spreading the word about Microsoft. The trailers carry everything from digital home to enterprise servers. HTS works with local Chambers of Commerce and colleges to drive attendance to the events, which are often aligned with other activities (football games, fairs, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, HTS has run 13 events with 100 attendees each. Lest you think this is just &#39;awareness&#39;, Larry said each event also adds $100K to their sales pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: Hold Seminars in Cooperation with Vendors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry has leveraged partner MDF funds and vendor field sales teams to hold a series of educational events, all under the HTS banner. These include one day seminars, lunch and learn sessions and webinars. Larry said the key was to have the vendors attend both for technical expertise but also to see the energy and interest in the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3: Run Office Technology Makeover Contests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/TW6IT1dMGS-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/TW6IT1dMGS-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; alt=&quot;HTS advert&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS advert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is the one that&#39;s going to pay for my conference. &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s pure gold.&lt;/strong&gt; What HTS has done is run an annual $25,000 Technology Makeover contest, where local businesses write in to explain how a technology makeover will transform their business. The local Chamber of Commerce promoted the event over the three months that applications were accepted and the local media picked up the story too. The only restriction to applying? Your business had to have less than 50 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four finalists and eventual winner are announced on the local news (again, in conjuntion with another newsworthy event like the Microsoft Across America van or state fair.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.avif 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.webp 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.jpeg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/iIhGCiHmTw-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;301&quot; alt=&quot;HTS winner announced&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS winner announced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, the winner was a local chocolate shop, who received network equipment, wiring, notebooks and three months Managed Services from HTS. All the vendors turned out for photos on &amp;quot;Makeover Day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.avif 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.avif 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.webp 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.webp 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.jpeg 400w, https://markdyck.ca/img/Ul7IbKhGog-700.jpeg 700w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/Ul7IbKhGog-400.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; alt=&quot;HTS makeover install&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;cluster font-display&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS makeover install&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the gold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every application is a qualified lead! Customers write, in detail, exactly why they would value these technologies and services. HTS is averaging $250,000 in the sales pipeline with each event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of HTS managed services, all the equipment is donated by the vendors, using partner marketing development funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of promotion costs is covered by the Chamber of Commerce and the story is seen as newsworthy by the local media. Promotion is organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, the program is nearly free and results in the best possible qualified leads for the HTS sales force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry shared many more sales and marketing ideas which I&#39;ll share with you in future posts, but their event marketing efforts are really taking off. They are getting customers excited about possibilities and are leveraging partner marketing funds to the hilt. As their CEO Arlin Stephenson says, &amp;quot;Over $1 billion of partner marketing funds goes unclaimed every year.&amp;quot; Claim it, get creative and grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTS serves a market very similar to SaskTel -- smaller cities and a rural economy. How can these ideas translate to our market, our customers and our partners?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s reason enough for me to add them to the &#39;lots o&#39; links&#39; section in the sidebar too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Community Gardens in Lakeview?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/community-gardens-in-lakeview/"/>
		<updated>2007-05-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/community-gardens-in-lakeview/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/sFhOLZosnU-335.avif 335w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/sFhOLZosnU-335.webp 335w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/img/sFhOLZosnU-335.jpeg 335w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/assets/images/image-placeholder.png&quot; data-src=&quot;/img/sFhOLZosnU-335.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; alt=&quot;city map with Macleod Park noted&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just sent off my letter of support to Grow Regina, who are working with the City to establish a new community garden in Lakeview. It&#39;ll be in what&#39;s known as Macleod Park, which is on Queen Street just south of Hill Avenue. It&#39;ll be a great addition to the community -- can&#39;t argue with more vegetables, and hopefully they&#39;ll get a nice mix of young and old folks out to tend their plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people expressed support for the plan at an open house in conjunction with the Lakeview CA fall registration night. Hopefully the approvals happen soon and the garden is ready by spring 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on taking a plot out -- I might finally get some decent potatoes and corn going. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No real link, since they just slam the info on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://regina.ca/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; (look for the header of Athletic Fields) so you&#39;ll have to check back, but they did publish a phone number. So now I will too: (306) 777-7484.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Insider Tip #1:  Central Scheduling</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/insider-tip-1-central-scheduling/"/>
		<updated>2007-05-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/insider-tip-1-central-scheduling/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m learning a lot today. For example, I just posted the phone number if you want to check if your ball diamond / field is rained out. Well it&#39;s the same number as Central Scheduling: the place you call if you want to book any city facility, neighbourhood centre, school gymnasium, ice rink, ditch, culvert or patch of grass. Have you ever been there? I have and it&#39;s not pretty. 2-3 frazzled looking (but very nice) people up to their eyes in application forms, phones ringing off the hook, etc. Nicest people you&#39;ve ever met, but wow are they busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s my first tip (maybe in a series if I figure out more) of how to make your interactions with the City as easy as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t call to book something if it&#39;s raining. Wait for a nice day, preferably after lunch when you&#39;re confident the weather will hold till evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don&#39;t call in June either. They just got 1000+ ice rink applications in the mail from hockey, ringette, figure skating, power skating and community people trying to claim a small piece of our eight (8) hockey rinks. If the others applicants are like me, the schedulers are then dealing with innumerable phone calls from people trying to change dates and times in February of the following year. (hey -- you try to think about power skating when it&#39;s +25 outside!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. Sunny days, not in June. You&#39;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus Tip: If you go in person (they&#39;re in a small room at the Fieldhouse), make sure to smile. They&#39;re really nice folks!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>City of Regina BizPal -- Strange Name, but might be useful</title>

		<updated>2007-05-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/city-of-regina-bizpal-strange-name-but-might-be-useful/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I was building out the links (psst: over there, on the right sidebar --&amp;gt; ) I stumbled across a wacky banner on the City of Regina web site. Turns out they&#39;ve launched a service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regina.ca/content/business/bizpal/bizpal.shtml&quot;&gt;BizPal.&lt;/a&gt; It appears to be a wizard to guide you through the complex but very important processes involved in obtaining a business permit or license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While digging around a little it seems to be a &#39;national&#39; app. I can get a license in the Yukon if I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might take a while to find on the city site but the link above takes you right to the wizard. Now stop selling those muffins door to door and go get legal!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Welcome!  Why are we here?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/welcome-why-are-we-here/"/>
		<updated>2007-05-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/welcome-why-are-we-here/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first post of Big Creek News. I&#39;ll gussy up the site a bit over the next couple days but I want to focus on content for a while first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this site exist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple version: I&#39;ve lived in Regina, Saskatchewan my entire life and in South Regina since around 1992. Most of my friends growing up have left the city, since &amp;quot;there&#39;s nothing going on in Regina.&amp;quot; That&#39;s hogwash! Whether you&#39;re 8 or 88, there are more things to do in this lovely city than hours in the day. What&#39;s missing is a place to learn what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex version: More to come over time. Suffice to say I hope we can share all the good things that our going on in town. I hope we can discuss the unpleasant things that go on in town as well, with an eye to working through issues. I think the term for this is &#39;Building Community&#39;, but I&#39;m not very precise with the Big Terms.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What&#39;s Office 2.0?</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-s-office-2-0/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/what-s-office-2-0/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s the next generation of Network Computer — the environment where you can run all the business apps you need via a web browser and save all your data online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can do this, then you can work from anywhere — the field, the office, the home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can do this, then your computer support costs go away (or at least get reduced a lot.) If all you need is a keyboard, screen, network connection and web browser, then how fast of a machine do you really need? How often will it fail? Why do you need to back it up? Why do you need an operating system as large as Vista?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/&quot;&gt;Ismael Ghalimi&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to pull this all together — to do every single thing, and store every single file, online. It’s a big challenge. He’s keeping track of &lt;a href=&quot;http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/my-office-20-setup/&quot;&gt;all the apps he needs&lt;/a&gt; and the online solutions. There’s lots of software. Each category has many alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would certainly be a (&lt;em&gt;inhale&lt;/em&gt;) ‘value added communications service on top of the network targetted at small business’ (&lt;em&gt;exhale&lt;/em&gt;) Wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-7345_3-6123652.html&quot;&gt;We’re not alone&lt;/a&gt;. Intel is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/07/intel-suitetwo-product-suite-launches/&quot;&gt;building suites too.&lt;/a&gt; But we don’t have to invent it to add value for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could pull together a suite (ok, a bundle) of these services for small business customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could offer the suite for much less than the cost of MS Office?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could support it as a suite rather than 40 independent products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could integrate it with handsets as well as PC’s?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Well then, what&#39;s Telco 2.0?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Telco 2.0: A research and consulting initiative created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stlpartners.com/&quot;&gt;STL&lt;/a&gt;, a UK based consulting company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telco 2.0: (from their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telco2.net/manifesto/&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”“Telco 2.0™” defines any business model where connectivity is supported by a sustainable economic model. This means the end of artificial cross-subsidies between services and connectivity. We assume an all-IP world where choice of applications, devices and platforms is entirely driven by user preference. Connectivity charges will increasingly reflect actual costs of delivery (unlike, say, mobile roaming charges); relatively trivial services like standard voice call routing are effectively free; and thus the scope for the latter subsidising the former ceases to exist Customers will only take your replacement offering because they want it, not because they have no choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT IF: we could use some of their business model frameworks when assessing our Service Development arenas?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Death of the Phone Company</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/death-of-the-phone-company/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/death-of-the-phone-company/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just re-read a Telco 2.0 post called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telco2.net/blog/2006/11/death_of_the_phone_company.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death of the Phone Company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; I understand more of it now than the first time but I’m still not sure I get it all. It’s a long post — there is likely more than one nugget in there. Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think it means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context (where you are / what you are doing) will drive the interface of all new “applications” –&amp;gt; cf. Forrester’s “Content Centric Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk or Voice will be only one feature of these applications. One of several ways to communicate with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web 2.0 ’social network’ apps / services are the key apps of the future. More and more, those are the ‘places’ people will be when they want to communicate or collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos don’t own the context today; the application providers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Telcos are losing the context, what are they going to do? Build their own social networking apps and try to grow market share, or partner with the app providers and make improve the overall customer experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcos have 2-5 years to figure this out or risk losing relevance (and revenue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>About the Company</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/about-the-company/"/>
		<updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://markdyck.ca/blog/about-the-company/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In January 2007, this was what the site was about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having lunch with a work colleague (he has since retired) and he mentioned that he was frustrated that he couldn’t get an internal blog started. I thought, “that’s odd”, since there are a lot of good, free blog services available. So I started this blog to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;post a bit, to show how relevant, interesting ideas can be aggregated in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invite my work colleagues to come to the blog to read it, comment and contribute (maybe within this blog, maybe with their own blog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;promote RSS services like Google Reader to show people how they can bring my posts (and other, even better posts) to one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this gets some traction, and our security group/corporate communications folks get scared, I’ll show them how we can bring the whole thing in-house with the same software (available at wordpress.org Voila! An internal blog service, with pre-built community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In August 2008, this is what the site was about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read things. I learn things. I talk to people. Every three months my notebook is full and I get a new one. But my ideas aren&#39;t getting any momentum. Since I&#39;m responsible for parts of the marketing strategy, that&#39;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formal, approved way to publish strategies is to write executive items and create powerpoint charts. No problem there. But that&#39;s the worst way to collaborate and spread ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m going to write here, share what I learn and over time some themes will emerge. Your comments will help that happen. When the themes get solid, I&#39;ll rewrite them into Executive Items and powerpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geez Louise! This is on the Internet!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it is. Take some deep, cleansing breaths. Ahhh...feeling better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s on the internet because I can set it up easily and it will integrate with feed readers like Google Reader. That way you can get public ideas in the same place as my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a private blog -- invitation only. I think these kinds of things should be public, so customers and partners can see what we&#39;re thinking about and add their comment, but that&#39;s a corporate hill I&#39;m not willing to climb right now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of markdown packages are installed to help you write your posts. You can configure them in &lt;code&gt;config/plugins/markdown.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of my personal preference, there are some presets. For example the automatic conversion of web pages to links (lenesaile.com) and the automatic addition of &lt;code&gt;target: &#39;_blank&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rel: &#39;noreferrer noopener&#39;&lt;/code&gt; for external links (all links with the pattern&lt;code&gt;/^https?:/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small pitfall! Take care to not prefix your internal links with your domain, or else they will be treated ad external as well. To link internally use this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;An internal link to the [about page](/about/)

		<title>Post with 301 redirects</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;URLs usually change over time, as you use another CMS or optimizye your file structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 301 is used when a page has permanently changed location.
Informing about this change is indispensable if you want to keep your incoming links working, be it from organic Google search or other pages that have linked to your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleksandr Hovhannisyan came up with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-netlify-redirects/&quot;&gt;elegant solution for Eleventy and Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. To directly cover several possible previous routes it is created as an array. You can find the loop in &lt;code&gt;_redirects.njk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Usage &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://markdyck.ca/blog/post-with-301-redirects/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/&quot;&gt;Eleventy Fetch&lt;/a&gt; fetches and caches resources - at configurable intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of fetching external data.
In this case, my public repositories (with more than zero stargazer) and a cache duration of 1 day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Open Graph images</title>
		<link href="https://markdyck.ca/blog/open-graph-images/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you share your blog posts, a thumbnail image may appear - the image we define in our meta data as an Open Graph Image (&lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starter now generates these images for your blog posts automatically.
The fallback and default image for all other pages is the image set as &lt;code&gt;opengraph_default&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;meta.js&lt;/code&gt; global data file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;meta-info.njk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;og:image&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;{{ meta.url }}&lt;br&gt;  {% if (layout == &#39;post&#39;) %}/assets/images/social-preview/{{ title | slugify }}-preview.jpeg&lt;br&gt;  {% else %}{{ meta.meta_data.opengraph_default }}&lt;br&gt;  {% endif %}&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the look and behaviour of those images and replace the SVG background edit &lt;code&gt;src/social-preview.njk&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bnijenhuis.nl/notes/automatically-generate-open-graph-images-in-eleventy/&quot;&gt;Bernard Nijenhuis article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
