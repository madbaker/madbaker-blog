There's lots of inspiration for this site.  Gonna keep a list of them here.

- the site is built with [Eleventy]() and deployed on [Netlify]().  It got started via the [Eleventy Base Blog]() starter.
- the way blog posts are listed and archives displayed all comes from [Simon at Photogabble](https://photogabble.co.uk)
- the flowing space and typography comes from Lena's [Eleventy Excellent]() starter, which is based on the ideas of [Andy Bell]()

- I'm still settling on Typography.  I might be bringing Quattrocento fonts from my old website (thank you [Kim](https://eastwillow.com)!) but I might also use [Atkinson Hyperlegible]() which I learned about via [Erik Kroes](https://www.erikkroes.nl/).  My focus on using semantic HTML also comes from reading Erik's work.

(Actually, I'm using Bitter.  And thanks to [Henry](https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-convert-variable-ttf-font-files-to-woff2/) I got Bitter installed as two compact variable webfont files.)

As for all the ways I want to use this site, from the indieweb to the rebirth of personal sites to inspiration for blogging more, I'll leave that to more detailed posts in the future.
