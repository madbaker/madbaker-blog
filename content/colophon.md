This is at least the fifth iteration of my personal website, going back to at least 2006.  I took a lot of inspiration from folks for this iteration:

The site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).   I'm so tired of page builders like in Wordpress or Squarespace.  All I really want to do is type markdown in a text editor and publish it.  Eleventy lets me do just that and I am so grateful.

The site began via the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/) starter but with some interesting (to me) additions:

  - the way blog posts are listed are inspired by [Simon at Photogabble](https://photogabble.co.uk)
  - I started adding short post descriptions after reading [Dana Byerly's](https://danabyerly.com/) blog ad junk drawer
- I want to add more of the flowing space and type from Lena Saile's [Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/) starter, which is based on the ideas of [Andy Bell](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/). And I'm definitely organzing the back-end of the website based on Lena's [configuration model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaN-mifrWk) But I'm adding the CSS in stages because my CSS skills are rudimentary and I want to understand what I'm doing.
- which brings me to Kev Quirk and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org).  Plain old HTML without CSS classes.  I'm using that as my base and adding on what I need to get to Andy's vision, as my knowledge grows.

- Typography is sans-serif system fonts, in keeping with the simple.css philosophy.  But I may add [Atkinson Hyperlegible]() to the stack which I learned about via [Erik Kroes](https://www.erikkroes.nl/).  My focus on using semantic HTML also comes from reading Erik's work.

(However, if you see serifs, that means I switched back to Bitter.  And thanks to [Henry](https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-convert-variable-ttf-font-files-to-woff2/) I got Bitter installed as two compact variable webfont files.)

As for all the ways I want to use this site, from the indieweb to the rebirth of personal sites to inspiration for blogging more, I'll leave that to more detailed posts in the future.
