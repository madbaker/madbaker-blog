<h1>Things to fix</h1>

~~- decide on a blog permalink structure~~
- figure out responsive images.  right now they are hardcoded in the eleventy short code.  
    - should I set size and widths by image or globally?
    - which widths should I use?
    - what variable sizes should i use and can I get it working?
