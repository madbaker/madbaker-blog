title: "June 16: Email Detox Day!"

I stumbled across some really interesting posts by [Tim Ferris](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/20/how-to-firewall-attention-and-reclaim-time/) about how blackberry addiction and, by extension, email addiction is wasting far more time than it's saving.

Tim's idea is to declare Father's Day "Email Detox Day" where we'll all go for 24 hours without checking email even one time. I'm in.

Spread the word!
