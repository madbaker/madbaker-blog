ARGH! I can't write anymore. I don't know why. It's pissing me off.

I think it's the return to corporate speak since baking school. Too many long, crappy, meaningless sentences which frustrate rather than educate.

When I'm riding or out for a long walk the ideas flow easy. I can frame out four blog posts and three presentations while walking along Wascana Creek. But when I sit down to write it turns out as "bargle, bargle, bargle, blah, blah, blah."

But there's hope, I think. [Naomi](http://ittybiz.com/) and [James](http://menwithpens.ca/) are helping me out. Go read their stuff. It's clear. It's direct. It's concise. And for someone with a blockage between brain and fingers, it's damned inspiring.
