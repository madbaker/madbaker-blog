There's reading about it, and then there's living it.

I'm a big fan of [Steven Pressfield's](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/) "[The War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/)."  The book is a kick in the head for all creative people, including writers and entrepreneurs.   It both names and to helps fight the Resistance, that shitty part of your brain that stops you from doing the (seemingly) risky, scary and essential creative work you were meant to do.

I've read all of Steven's non-fiction work and it helps.  But oh boy it's not helping this month.  The damn Resistance has me hard.  It's clawing at my brain stem right now.

Some may call it a migraine, but I know exactly what it is.  You don't just get a migraine when you sit down to write.  But I've had three over the past week. Each time it takes me three days to get the courage up to write again.

I tried to trick it, by painting or recording a video instead of writing.  Smart, eh?

Well it wasn't me that was being smart.  It was that f'ing Resistance again, deflecting the whole time.  Don't create!  Research a new medium instead.  Look for tripods.  Adjust the lighting.  Watch yourself umm and ahh on video instead of writing clearly like you can.

It took a 'knock me in bed' migraine today to finally get it.  I See You.  You prick.

I'm writing about you now, Resistance.  Then I'm hitting Publish.

Then I'm finishing my article.  And starting another one.

You won for the last three weeks.  I won today.
