One of the things I try to do in all my work is to take a new approach or a fresh angle at solving an old problem.  Whether it's transforming my [community association](http://lcaregina.ca) to be more about looking out than looking inward, or bringing brand new bread to my neighbourhood, or even a new style of presentations to my [day job](http://sasktel.com), I want to Wow people.

Andy Nulman is a man who has indirectly guided me along this journey.  He's the author of [one of my favourite blogs](http://powrightbetweentheeyes.typepad.com) and has just finished a new book called POW! -- Profiting from the Power of Surprise.  It's a book I've been waiting for.

In support of his book launch, Andy's giving away 200 copies of his new book to bloggers who [link back to his site.](http://powrightbetweentheeyes.typepad.com/pow_right_between_the_eye/2009/01/200-free-pow-booksan-offer-you-cant-refuse.html)  I'd gladly [link back](http://andynulman.com) for free, but just in case, here's my address Andy  :-)
