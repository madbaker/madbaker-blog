We're up at the top of the Lake Louise gondola, looking back at the  
lake, chateau and glacier. The sky has quite a bit of smoke haze,  
which I assume is from the wildfires in the Okanagan valley, 600km to  
the west.  
   
I'm shocked by the size of the glaciers. It's been 8 years since I've  
been here and to my mind the glaciers are way smaller than the last  
time we were here. And not just Lake Louise - all over. Climate  
change in action, I suppose.
