I was inordinately happy at suppertime today.  Ben and Robyn and her friend Josh were all home for supper.  Cindy and I made a nice, simple pasta dish, with a salad and garlic toast.   We started cooking at 5pm and sat down to eat at 6.

That may sound rather boring but we needed to be on vacation to pull off a standard, nothing fancy but made from scratch meal.

One of the things that I miss the most about life “before the bakery” is the absence of proper meals.  That is, supper made at home, served between 6pm and 7:30pm, and eaten at a table by at least two or maybe all four of us.  Our crazy sleep patterns mean that this very rarely happens.

Why is that?  Time, really.  Time of day, that is.   Cindy and I typically get home from the bakery between 1pm and 2pm and our bodies are screaming for lunch.  Aside from a snack at the bakery we really haven’t eaten a meal since 3:30am and that is typically a bowl of cereal or some toast.  So by lunch time we are hung-a-ry!

So a big lunch at 2 means we’re not really hungry at 5, so who wants to make supper then?  Not me, that’s for sure.  And maybe I’m up for a snack by 7:30, but I thought one’s not supposed to eat and then go straight to bed.  I try to get to bed by 8pm, 9 at the latest so a proper supper is always crashing in on my bedtime.

I think the proper solution is to make supper when Cindy and I get home from work, even if it’s at 2pm.  Then the kids have something to eat at a more normal time, even if it’s left overs.  And we get more time for things to settle before bed.

Now I just need to get the energy to cook after a long day of baking.  That’s a lot of time spent in a kitchen! But it’s worth it if that means we can eat better and maybe lose our ‘too much drive thru’ pudginess.
