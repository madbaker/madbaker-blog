Strange 10 days. I thought it was going to snow over Victoria Day weekend (it did snow north of us) but now it's spring again. I went for two long bike rides over the weekend and it was pure joy. The kids are taking kayak classes on Saturday and Sunday for the next few weeks so I'll have 90 minutes to ride while they're in the water. Sure beats watching them play hockey!
