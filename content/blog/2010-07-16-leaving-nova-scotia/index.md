We were planning to camp right by the ferry station on the NS side, but it's full. So we caught the 8pm ferry to PEI.

I thought we'd have lots of killer light for pics, but the clouds took care of that early. I got one of the sunset and a lighthouse just as we were leaving Nova Scotia behind and turning toward PEI.


Tomorrow, the beaches have red sand, and all the fries are home fries!
