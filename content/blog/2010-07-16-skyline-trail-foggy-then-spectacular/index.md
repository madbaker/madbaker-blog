We revisited the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands Park, although we weren't sure what to expect. It was one of the highlights of our 2005 trip but this morning was very foggy.

The trail started like a trip through the Forbidden Forest, and by the time we made it to the headlands we couldn't see a thing. We spent about 30 minutes taking pictures of the nothingness.

Then, just as we were heading back down the trail, the skies cleared. We hurried back to a glorious view of French Mountain, the headlands, and the ocean. We could see clear across to Cheticamp. Well worth the wait!

It was also cool to run into Monica Rivers and her family on the trail, who are also from Regina. Small worl indeed...
