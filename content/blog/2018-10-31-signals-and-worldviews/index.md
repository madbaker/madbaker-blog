We've been discussing "signals" quite a bit in over in [_the_ Right Company](https://therightcompany.co)  community. From the price you set to the metaphors you employ to the typeface you use in your newsletters, every item you send out in the world sends a signal.

However, each signal runs through a filter before it is received. And that filter is the worldview of the receiver.

The six page contract that came last week for a 30 minute presentation I'd agreed to give (in exchange for gas money) is a case in point.

Even my single worldview drew out three distinct reactions.

- What a power play! They're just trying to push me down a peg. Service Provider - pfft.
- Talk about bureaucracy! It cost them more to create the contract than the gas money. All for a 30 minute talk. What a waste.
- That poor lady. She must be embarrassed to have to send me such a crazy contract for a tiny thing.

I'm sure you can think of more.

Now, the contract itself isn't good or bad. A verbal agreement would create just as many reactions.

The question for us as leaders, storytellers and marketers isn't "should I use a contract?" It's not even "how will people respond to this signal?"

The more important question is "How will a person with the worldview I'm trying to connect with react to this signal?" Others will react differently and that's OK.

The problem arises when we send a signal and are surprised by the response.
