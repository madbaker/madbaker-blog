Our last night on Cape Breton was at the lovely Whycocomah Provincial Park. Huge grassy sites with great views of the village across the water.

One unique "feature", however is the placement of the washrooms. They're quite a way from our site, and way down the hill too. The quad and glute workout is free!

In the pic, our tent is up and to the right of the picnic table waaay up the hill.
