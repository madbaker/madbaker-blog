I'm writing this from snug in our tent because it's doing this rain-like thing outside. I think the locals would call it rain, although it's new to me. There aren't any real raindrops falling; just a persistent drizzle that soaks you just like a thunderstorm. So we're snug and dry but don't have the usual noise. It's definitely wet, though...
