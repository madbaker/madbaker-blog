I've been thinking hard today about why I write, why I want to write more and why I want to get better at this.  As can be expected, this is a work in progress, but here's what I have so far:

- **I just plain admire writers.**  Writers who make the complex seem simple. Who make me laugh.  Who make me cry.  Writers who inspire me to live my life fully and do great things.   I want to be one too.
- **Writing makes me extroverted.** Deep down I'm a really shy guy.   I'm not the person who's going to make contact in a crowded room.  It's a real force of will to make a phone call some days.  But I'm a bolder, more outgoing person when I write.
- **I want to teach.** I want you to bake great bread.  I want you to eat great bread.  I don't ever want you to have a bad meal or a bad outing in Regina, or any city I've been to.  I want to be a better person and help you be a better person.
- I **want to entertain you.** A nod.  A smile.  A belly laugh.  I want to be the guy who makes your day better.
- **I write to make sense of things.**  There are a lot of ideas rolling around in my noggin and writing helps me make sense of my own thoughts.  I've written several posts that start as a problem and then have to be re-written, since the act of writing about the problem opens up the solution.
- **I write to silence my inner critic.**   Left to its own devices, my mind will destroy me.  Oh yes it will.  90% of the time my lizard brain is telling me I'm no good, I'm a fraud who will soon be found out, and I'm better off just quitting everything and go for a nap.

Bottom line for me is that **I write to touch people.** Whether it's a blog post or a love note.  Whether I get a comment or it just fades away.  I want to make a connection with you and change you a little.

Even if it's as simple as [slicing your own bread.](/_site/blog/2013-03-praise-for-the-unsliced-loaf/)
