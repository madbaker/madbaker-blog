Hi!  We're Mark and Cindy Dyck and finally, after years of dreaming and planning and plotting and scheming, we're taking our dream trip to Europe.  Three months of walking and hiking and trains and buses.  We're so excited we can hardly stand it.

We've dreamed about this trip forever, but there was always something else to do.  Work, raising two amazing kids, setting up house and even opening a bakery.  But the kids are in University now, the bakery is (temporarily) closed and it's time for adventure!

We're Canadian Prairie folk and proud of it.  And we've seen most of Canada over the years (typically in a tent!)  But this is our first trip overseas.   We're going to travel in Europe the same way we travel in Canada - frugally, curiously, openly and with a focus on the adventures one can find in everyday life. We can't wait to meet new people, make new friends and experience new cultures.

Mark's the writer.  Cindy's the photographer.  Together we're going to share the little gems that make this trip special to us.

And we'll be sure to share our screw-ups too.  They'll be a good laugh for our more experienced world-travelling friends and maybe a good lesson for folks who haven't made the travel leap yet.

Onward!
