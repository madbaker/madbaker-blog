Great day today as it marks the release of a new manifesto from the idea spreading guru [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/).  It's all about [forming and leading tribes](http://changethis.com/50.01.Tribes).

Seth's all about spreading ideas and has written at length about getting remarkable ideas to spread.  The concept of tribes expands on this -- it's about creating a platform so it's easy for people (your tribe) to spread your ideas.

I've spent quite a bit of time this summer working on our [local community association](http://lcaregina.ca) website and have been trying to embrace the tribe idea.  But I'll leave that for another post.  For now, [download Seth's ebook](http://changethis.com/50.01.Tribes) , give it 3 or 4 good reads and tell me what you think in the comments!
