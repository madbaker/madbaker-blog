While the oven may be snowbound and Van may be iced up, this week's cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls has brought one of my favourite people back to life. Ben, aka Snow Boy, has once again magically transformed from moody bookworm to icy adventurer. Within 24 hours, there was a 4 foot igloo in the front yard. By Day Two, the igloo had three exits. Work on the side rooms is progressing nicely.

Snow Boy's autumn nemesis, Buddy Dog, is now his faithful companion, spending hour after finger numbing hour in the back yard fetching hunks of snow and ice. Boy and Dog seem to embrace the frozen white stuff as their native habitat.
