Sitting at the HI Hostel in Victoria after a long travel day. The trip went fine, got the van no problem and found the hostel without a hitch. Just like world travellers...

We had a chance for a long walk around the inner harbour. Robyn was fascinated by the Empress Hotel and wants to draw it tomorrow. Ben liked Barb's fish and chips. I liked Cobs Bakery and the Market on Yates St. I haven't asked what Cindy liked yet.

Time for a late supper and bed...
