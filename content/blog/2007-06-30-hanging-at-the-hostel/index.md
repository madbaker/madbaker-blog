When we get tired of life in the tent we've fallen into the habit of staying in hostels. It's a good way to meet new people, save money on food (they all have kitchens) and save some money while sleeping in a warm bed. Right now we're hanging out at the Painted Turtle hostel in Nanaimo and it's the best.

We're full up tonight due to the holiday weekend and there are some really great folks here. James from Australia is showing his DVD of his own personal version of Stupid Human Tricks. That James is a crazy guy. Seems to enjoy jumping off stuff with a bucket on his head. Over supper a few folks started a really wild singalong too accompany the cooks. Sweet. Cindy and Robyn bought me a birthday cake big enough to share which doesn't hurt either :-)

If you need a fun place to stay in Nanaimo, this is it. Come check it out.
