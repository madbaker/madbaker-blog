I read a good post from Dan Pink about the [workplace is a desert when it comes to feedback](http://www.danpink.com/archives/2010/11/three-ways-to-make-the-workplace-richer-in-feedback). Well worth reading the full article (here: [http://bit.ly/eaUVI7](http://bit.ly/eaUVI7) ). Not dissing the level of feedback at SaskTel; we have several programs like he recommends, but it's a good reminder. 

Dan's article reminds me of two cool TED videos on gaming culture and how feedback from games can be used for good. There's a connection here, I can feel it!
