Robyn and I are on the second leg of our hockey weekend. Yesterday was Swift Current. This morning we headed southeast to Glentworth Sk to face the Wood River Whirling Dervishes (at least I thin that's there name.)

It was a great drive. We saw a coyote and several deer, including a large buck. The remoteness was fascinating and overwhelming. I'd have a lot of trouble adjusting to living 100km+ from the nearest grocery store.

I stopped for some pics halfway along the 170km drive from Swift Current.
