Here's another example of what we do with leftover dough. This is a 'white' sourdough loaf that has been baked an extra long time. It may look burnt but it's not at all. The smell is a deep, rich caramel and the taste is exquisite.

The end result is an entirely different loaf than a basic sourdough -- much more complex flavour. I really like it!
