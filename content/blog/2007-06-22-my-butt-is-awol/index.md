I don't know what happened, but 10 days into this trip and my butt has disappeared. Maybe it's the nuts and berries we're eating on hikes, or the two city block walk to the bathrooms, or hauling surfboards half a mile from the beach, but my new shorts keep falling down. The kids think it's funny.

Budda belly is well and good, however.
