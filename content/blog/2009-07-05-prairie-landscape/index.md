[_image lost in a dumpster fire_]

I'm rereading "Brilliant Orange", an outstanding history of Dutch football in the context of their culture, art, architecture and landscape. The author, David Winner, makes the connection between the best Dutch footballer's ability to create space on the pitch with the Dutch abiity to literally create a country out of the sea.

The vast land creation by dike and canal building makes for a flat and uniform landscape. One that, in my imagination anyway, seems a lot like the prairie landscape in southern Saskatchewan.

I was thinking of this on the drive to Saskatoon yesterday when I saw this view. Great light, dark clouds and the bright yellow canola fields. Â An amazing view, but quite common around here.
