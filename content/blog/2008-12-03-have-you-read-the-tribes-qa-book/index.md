I must have been abducted by aliens and had my memory wiped out since I completely forgot to tell you all about the [Tribes Q&A ebook](http://tinyurl.com/TribesQA). It's another collaboration from [Seth Godin's](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) tribe of followers -- some of the nicest, smartest and most creative people I've ever met.

This ebook answers some of the questions that seem to come up when people try to apply Seth's ideas about forming and leading tribes.   I could go on, but fellow triiibster [Paul Durban](http://www.youtube.com/user/PaulOnStage) is a genius at expressing ideas through pictures, so let's have Paul explain it for you.

In case you also missed the first e-book, [containing over 200 pages of tribe case studies](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/free-tribes-ebo.html), you can find that one [here.](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/CurrentTribesCasebook.pdf) My case study made it in too -- it's on page 91!
