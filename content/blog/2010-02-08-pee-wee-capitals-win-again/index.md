Congratulations to the Regina Pee Wee Female Capitals who won their second tournament of the season. This weekend it was the Swift Current tourney which the Capitals won after beating the Weyburn Angels 3-2 in the final on Sunday.

The girls did well to get to the final, beating the Diefenbaker Thunder 4-1 and Saskatoon Comet Snipers 5-0.

Their best game was a 1-1 tie with the fast, rough and tough Swift Current Colts on Saturday night. It was a nail biter right to the final buzzer.

What a great job by all the Capitals!
