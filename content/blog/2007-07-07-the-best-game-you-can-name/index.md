We've been out of 'net coverage for a while now - camping at French Beach and checking out the beaches and marine life at Botany Bay, Botanical Beach and China Beach. But today we're back in Victoria and that can only mean one thing...

SOCCER!!

Only 4 hours till kickoff of today's U20 world cup matches. I'm extremely excited.

We've heard lots of horror stories about secutiry - long lines, no food or drink allowed in , no re-entry (and we'll be there for 5-6 hours). But, we're bringing lots of cash and sun hats. It was good to have the notice though- there was nothing in the tickets that mentioned this. Oh well.

Full report to follow!
