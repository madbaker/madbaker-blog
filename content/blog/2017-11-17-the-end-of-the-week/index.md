title: "The End Of The Week"

I've been deep in a post altMBA funk this week. I've got my project plan and my task list but I'm just not working at it enough to ship on time.

When confronted by being stuck like this, especially when it's self inflicted, my first reaction is that my deadlines are soft. Or at least out too far.

One of the best things about the altMBA format is that there is something due every single day. So there's nowhere to hide. No way to get around to it later. You gotta ship, period.

Some of us, me included, like to set weekly goals. I'll ship by the end of the week.

But Monday quickly turns into Tuesday turns into Wednesday. Laundry is done, the house is (relatively) clean, groceries purchased, side projects tended to.

Then as the sun sets on Thursday night, you realize you haven't really got going on The Big Project. The one with the deadline.

That's when the downward spiral picks up steam. The funk gets funkier. Not good.

No, better to have a daily deadline and mean it. Promise yourself you'll pay the neighbour (the one you don't like that much) $20 if you don't ship tonight. And tomorrow. And the next day.

Get a stack of twenties and put them on your desk as a reminder.

Then get to work. We need you to ship.
