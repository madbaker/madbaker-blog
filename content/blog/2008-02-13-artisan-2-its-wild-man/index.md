My Artisan 2 course started on Monday.  This course is 95% dedicated to wild yeast bread, aka sourdough.  Sourdough breads take longer to develop and rise, and there's more effort involved in keeping our wild yeast cultures healthy.   That's why I'm a little behind in my posting -- I get back from school, eat some bread and go to sleep.

BUT!  We're making some great bread, I have pictures, and will share some after school tonight.

PS -- the other 5% of the course is decorative shaping techniques, which will be fun too.  Most of that is Friday afternoon, I believe.
