We went on a three hour sea kayaking tour yesterday along Porpoise Bay. What a great time! Although I admit I felt a little like that wooden model canoe from the children's cartoon at the start. A wee bit tippy and tough to steer. After a couple minutes though it was smooth going.

We saw a lot of wildlife - bald eagles mostly, but the highlight was a pair of seals who kept bobbing up right beside the kayaks, checking us out then diving down for a while. Quite a treat!

We went over to a marine park where we could camp overnight if we wanted. Lots of tide pools and starfish there.

Kayaking is a pile of fun. I can see myself buying a "lake" kayak when I get home. Very peaceful and fun way to travel.
