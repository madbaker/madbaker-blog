We're in Tofino for a couple days and are trying to figure out what to do. We went whale watching yesterday (more on that later) and any other big adventure here is going to hit our budget pretty hard. One thing that's getting cut is a trip to a nearby hot springs. Looks great, but it's 1.5 hours one way by boat. Sounds like fun, but that translates to 400 dollars for the family to go. That's a lot of coin for a soak.

In other news, we still haven't figured out how to have a shower here. Heard a rumour that the laundromat in town might have showers too. Otherwise I might just have to shave my head. That or get some dreadlocks going.
