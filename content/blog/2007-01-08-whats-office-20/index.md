It’s the next generation of Network Computer — the environment where you can run all the business apps you need via a web browser and save all your data online.

If you can do this, then you can work from anywhere — the field, the office, the home office.

If you can do this, then your computer support costs go away (or at least get reduced a lot.) If all you need is a keyboard, screen, network connection and web browser, then how fast of a machine do you really need? How often will it fail? Why do you need to back it up? Why do you need an operating system as large as Vista?

[Ismael Ghalimi](http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/) is attempting to pull this all together — to do every single thing, and store every single file, online. It’s a big challenge. He’s keeping track of [all the apps he needs](http://itredux.com/blog/office-20/my-office-20-setup/) and the online solutions. There’s lots of software. Each category has many alternatives.

It would certainly be a (_inhale_) ‘value added communications service on top of the network targetted at small business’ (_exhale_) Wouldn’t it?

[We’re not alone](http://news.com.com/2100-7345_3-6123652.html). Intel is [building suites too.](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/07/intel-suitetwo-product-suite-launches/) But we don’t have to invent it to add value for our customers.

WHAT IF: we could pull together a suite (ok, a bundle) of these services for small business customers?

WHAT IF: we could offer the suite for much less than the cost of MS Office?

WHAT IF: we could support it as a suite rather than 40 independent products?

WHAT IF: we could integrate it with handsets as well as PC’s?
