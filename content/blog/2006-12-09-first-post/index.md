Well Hi,

So here's my first post on my Wordpress blog. I've been "firmly persuaded" to write more and I wanted to do that in a way that I could share it, add photos, video, etc. and Wordpress looks like a good place to do just that.

I'm not completely sure what to write about, or at least how to organize it. Lots of interests, you might say. But one of the things I'm tired of is waiting to get everything figured out before I take a step and that bad habit stops right here and now.

That is, it stops with the next post.
