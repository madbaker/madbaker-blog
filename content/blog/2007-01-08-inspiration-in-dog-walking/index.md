title: "Inspiration in Dog Walking"

I've been having trouble thinking of topics to write about this week. Well, 'Personal Blog' stuff anyway. I spent some time pulling together a quick 'Business Blog' (_now incorporated as [The Company](/_site/tags/the-company/)) to show some colleagues at work. If there's some interest I might get one started at work. But it's been tough finding things worth writing about once I finally sit down at the computer.

That is, until I took Buddy for a walk tonight. I wasn't three houses down the street before I started formulating several ideas in my head. Too bad I couldn't write and walk at the same time.

I think this calls for a new routine -- dog walking followed by a beeline to the blog site. Maybe I'll put my laptop on the kitchen counter by the door...
