Cindy and I walked down to the Farmer's Market today. It was fun to see the vendors again and catch up on things. It's been two years since I baked for the Market but lots of people still want to see our bread there.

There was lots of interest in our trip and what we saw. There was even more interest in what we were doing next. Sadly, I think my response was a poor one.

I have this habit of telling people I need to figure something out, because I can't be "unemployed" for much longer. But that's the wrong answer.

- I'm already talking to several places in town about starting or improving their bread production
- There are people signed up to The Baker's Bench who are ready for another baking course
- I'm running into people on the street who say they enjoy our travel blog and want me to keep writing

So whether I say it or not, I'm already a baker, a teacher and a writer. And I'm doing all those things. I just didn't get paid today.

It's too easy to describe ourselves only in terms of what we do for money. That's a trap. There's a lot more going on in all of us.
