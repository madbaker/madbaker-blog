The University of Regina Engineering faculty puts on an excellent series of summer day camps for kids called [EYES](http://uregina.ca/eyes/) -- or Educating Youth in Engineering and Science. The week long programs include robot building, making thing explode/crash/foam/turn green and lots more fun science. My 11 year old when last summer and he had an absolute blast!

If you've got a child in the 9-13 year range, make sure to check this program out.
