One of the best things of [the altMBA](http://altmba.com/) course is that we were forced to ship a new thing every day.

Either a project, or good feedback on other projects, or reflections on the feedback we received.

Every. Single. Day.

Sometimes two things.

At first, I didn't think I could do it, especially around my other work. I was literally spinning around trying to get myself under control. Scrambling to make every deadline.

But after the first week, I got my feet under me and fell into a sort of rhythm. I had 'work time' and 'home time' and 'altMBA time.'

And you know what, not only did everything get done, but it got done well. Or at least, good enough.

### Shipping is More Important Than Perfection

The biggest lesson is that you're better off shipping something on time rather than getting it perfect.

Why is that?

- You'll never hit perfect anyway. It's just a stall tactic in your head to avoid the vulnerability of shipping something real.
- The longer you wait, the longer you avoid getting feedback. This is no good. Quality feedback will change your work anyway, or at least your ideas. Better to ship and get that feedback quickly
- Missing dates is addictive. It's too easy to miss your second date. So don't miss even one.

### Imperfect Is Not Garbage

It's just not perfect.

There's a difference between shipping crap and shipping imperfect work.

I define 'crap' as dishonest, shallow, or purposefully vague work.

'Imperfect' is still honest, deep, thoughtful work. Maybe it's not 100% complete, or could benefit from some generous feedback, but the core is there.

If you feel you need to keep polishing, just ship. Get the feedback then ship again.

You'll be glad you did.
