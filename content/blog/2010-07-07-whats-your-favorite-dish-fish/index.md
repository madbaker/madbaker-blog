The family pecking order for Good Eats on this trip goes something like this:

\- home fries: Required  
\- great fish: Required  
\- burgers or chicken for Robyn (who doesn't eat seafood): must be nearby.  
\- pop in bottles, from local brewer: 1point bonus  
\- a shack where you stand in line to order: 1 point bonus.  
\- picnic tables out back with a view of water: 3 point bonus.

The Battered Fish on Halifax harbour scores full points. Pure bliss!
