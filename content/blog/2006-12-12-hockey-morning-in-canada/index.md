Up at 6:15AM for Robyn's 7:30 practice in White City. There weren't many kids out and even fewer parents. I usually like the early morning stuff because I have the whole day in front of me after hockey. Although right now I'm pretty darn tired.

Robyn got to practice in goal and did really well for her first time in pads this year. She hasn't mentioned goal much this year but now that she's had a practice she's eager to play in a game. My thoughts? Officially they don't matter and it's good for her to try all the positions, but I sure wouldn't mind having one child play out, purely from the spectators point of view.

We all went out for breakfast after the practice. Went to McDonald's which wasn't my or Robyn's first choice but it actually wasn't that bad. Perhaps the McDioxins are merging with my cell structure, or maybe because they have Hockey Cards!

It was a good chance to talk with more of the parents. More and more of the kids are involved in Basketball these days; half the team had games or practices at 10. The fees seem reasonable (100-150 per year) but wow that's a big time commitment if you're also playing hockey. I can't see how our kids would survive playing two sports at the same time when each sport is twice a week.
