Wild weekend on the minor hockey front. We kicked things off with a Regina Pats game attended by both teams which was a lot of fun, although a ticket mixup meant the two teams were on opposite sides of the arena. I got some good mileage walking back and forth to check on the kids.

The rest of the weekend was spent with dueling ice times, but somehow everyone showed up where they needed to be.

Robyn got her second start in goal and earned her first ever shutout. She was on top of the world all night after that game, to say the least.

Ben played well in a 5-2 loss to the Phantoms, in a game that was marred by some chippy play and some really nasty hits. The Phantoms had a large size advantage over the smaller Sharks and their coaches seemed to encourage the players to knock the pee out of everyone regardless of size. Why crush a kid when a push will do? I don't know. In the end there were 18 penalties called and one Phantom got ejected ([the irony is the ejection wasn't the worst hit of the game.)

I don't think there is a place for smaller kids to play minor hockey once they turn 11 and that's very sad indeed.
