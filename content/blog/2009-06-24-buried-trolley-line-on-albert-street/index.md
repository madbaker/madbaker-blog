_I'm leaving this here as a reminder of the single biggest mistakes I've made as a blogger -- relying on a third party service to post to my blog.  I used a service called Posterous for quite a while and when they went under, I saved my posts but didn't save the images.  So you can't see this photo of Albert Street and I don't have it anywhere.  Sigh. The tracks have been paved over too._
  

I took this photo while walking to work last week -- it's a bit of urban archeology as a City work crew (who is re-paving Albert Street Bridge) uncovered the old trolley lines that used to run the length of Albert Street.  

  

Then they proceeded to cut them out and continue repaving.

  

Too bad in a way.  It made me think about what Regina would be like if it was still compact enough to support a trolley line.
