I've been mesmerized by several really good online videos lately. They are visually stunning but I realize now that I'm attracted to the music as much as anything -- original music which really matches the tempo of the video.

I was a big New Order fan in the 80's so perhaps this is a throwback to New Age music but there's something new to it as well. For one, I find it a lot more soothing and inspiring. Music for Web 2.0? Music for the last half of the '00s? I don't know what to call it, but I like it.

Here's three examples of incredible videos which are made even better by the music:

#1: I saw this video about to transition from text to hypertext to xml to Web 2.0 on [Chris Anderson's Long Tail Blog](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/02/this_is_what_im.html)

{% youtube '6gmP4nk0EOE', 'Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us' %}



#2: Here's a great take-off [PowerPoint](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/01/an_examination_.html) presentations, which I first saw over at [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com/)

{% youtube 'lWWKBY7gx_0' , 'Le Grand Content'%}
 

#3: Another from [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com/) which links to a video on [Trusted Computing](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/01/can_i_trust_you.html):

(_alas, the video was deleted sometime between 2007 and 2023_ ðŸ˜•)

Cool Tunes or what?
