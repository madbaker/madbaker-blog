I just sent off my letter of support to Grow Regina, who are working with the City to establish a new community garden in Lakeview. It'll be in what's known as Macleod Park, which is on Queen Street just south of Hill Avenue. It'll be a great addition to the community -- can't argue with more vegetables, and hopefully they'll get a nice mix of young and old folks out to tend their plots.

A lot of people expressed support for the plan at an open house in conjunction with the Lakeview CA fall registration night. Hopefully the approvals happen soon and the garden is ready by spring 2008.

I plan on taking a plot out -- I might finally get some decent potatoes and corn going. How about you?
