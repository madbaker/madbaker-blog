I've acquired a slight head cold so that can mean only one thing -- I'm heading off on an airplane! Yep, I leave Sunday for the [Stellent Crescendo](http://www.stellentcrescendo.com/Crescendo/index.htm) conference. I'll be meeting with some of our [hosting](http://sasktel.com/business/small/managed-applications/index.html?Link=HostingMgmtServices-SMB&campaign=HomePage) customers, the Stellent sales / partner crew and hopefully learn some more about content management too.

The only downside (other than the massive sinus pain I will indoubtably suffer) is that I'll miss most of the Super Bowl. I'm loading up on pre-game hype instead. My motto is the same as [NFL network](http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/home) -- everything but the game!

I'll blog as much as I can from the conference, but I'll have to split between internal stuff and what I can share publically. Hopefully you'll get more than descriptions of the beaches and palm trees.

Some extra links: The conference is at the lovely [Hotel Del Coronado](http://www.hoteldel.com/)

I'll be staying at the even more wonderful (for me) [La Avenida Inn](http://www.laavenidainn.com/) across the street. To be honest, I'm not one for ultra-swanky accomodations and this is a great little hotel I discovered when I was here back in 2000. Clean rooms, great location and friendly staff. That's all I could ever want!
