I went for a Canada Day walk through Wascana Park today, with [Marc Maron's interview with Neil Young](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-717-neil-young) in my ears.  If I was going to ignore the cover bands playing in the park, I figured I should at least listen to a Canadian interview.

They were talking about love and art.  Neil said the key was to be fearless.  If you're fearless, you open yourself up to real love.  You can't make art, or make love work, if you're hiding.

I turned 50 two days ago and this morning I caught myself, once again, worrying about everything.  Money, time, and the lack of both.  Fear of being rejected or worse yet, ignored.  Yet again, being afraid to write and to work and to live.

Enough!  I'm 50 years old for crying out loud!  What, am I going to be afraid till I'm 60?  70?

If not now, then when?
