Wow, what happened to summer? It sure came quick and left just as quickly. Remember those +38C days in July?

But now autumn is here and if you want to stay active this winter it's important not to miss your local community association's registration night. No matter where you are in Regina, your community association will be having a registration night on **Tuesday, September 12 at 7PM** Locations vary by community association -- check out your CA website or newsletter for more details.
