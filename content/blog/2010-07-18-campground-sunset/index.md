I kid you not - this is the sunset from our campsite at Cabot Provincial Park in PEI. Our site is on the grass overlooking Malbeque Harbour.

They don't have campfire fireplaces in PEI parks. It's just a hole in the grass with the red sand underneath. So cooking is a new and interesting challenge. We were up for it, although the menu was simplified.

Tomorrow we move to the house we rented for the last leg of our trip and join up with Cindy's family. I look forward to having a home base but might still pitch the tent for old time's sake. Our old tent has served us well for nearly 20 years but with the kids growing there's not much extra room.
