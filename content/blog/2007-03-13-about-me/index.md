My name is Mark Dyck and I live in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

I'm still figuring out what to blog about; I've got lots of interests and no clear focus. So you could read about:

- brick oven bread baking
- minor hockey 
- content management 
- product marketing 
- Web 2.0 tools 
- blogs, social media, wikis and the like 
- citizen media 
- better powerpoint presentations 
- starting and growing a small business

I tend towards thinking too much and writing too little; switching that around is my top priority!
